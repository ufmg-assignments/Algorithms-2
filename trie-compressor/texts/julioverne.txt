Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included. Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so. To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month. Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. This
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
We need your donations more than ever!
All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law. (CMU = CarnegieMellon University).

without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any

Chapter 1
In Which Phileas Fogg and Passepartout Accept Each Other,
the One as Master, the Other as Man
Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No.7, Saville Row, Burlington
Gardens. He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform
Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention. This
Phileas Fogg was a puzzling gentleman, about whom little was
known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People
said that he resembled the poet Byron - at least that his head
was Byronic; but he was a bearded, peaceful Byron, who might live
on a thousand years without growing old.
Certainly Phileas Fogg was an Englishman, but it was more
doubtful whether he was a Londoner. He was never seen on 'Change,
nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the "City"; no
ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he
had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the
Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's
Inn. Nor had he ever pleaded in the Court of Chancery, or in the
Exchequer, or the Queen's Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He
certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a
gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and
learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the
sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London
Institution, the Artisan's Association, or the Institution of
Arts and Sciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous
societies which swarm in the English capital.
Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all. The
way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple
enough.
He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open
credit. His checks were regularly paid at sight from his account
current, which was always flush.
Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best
could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was
the last person to whom to go for the information. He was not
lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew
that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose,
he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously. He was, in
short, the least communicative of men. He talked very little, and
seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. His daily
habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so
exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the
wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.
Had he traveled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know the
world more familiarly. There was no spot so secluded that he did
not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often
corrected, with a few clear words, the thousand conjectures
advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of
travelers, pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as if
gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify
his predictions. He must have traveled everywhere, at least in
the spirit.
It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not been away from
London for many years. Those who were honored by a better
acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could
pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes
were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this
game, which, as a quiet one, harmonized with his nature; but his
winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for
his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of
playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a
difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to
his tastes.
Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which
may happen to the most honest people; neither relatives nor near
friends, which is certainly more unusual. He lived alone in his
house in Saville Row, where none ever entered. A single servant
sufficed to serve him. He breakfasted and dined at the club, at
hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table,
never taking his meals with other members, much less bringing a
guest with him. He went home at exactly midnight, only to retire
at once to bed. He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform
provides for its favored members. He passed ten hours out of the
twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his
toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step
in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular
gallery with its dome supported by twenty red Ionic
columns, and illumined by blue painted windows. When he
breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club - its
kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy - aided to crowd his
table with their most succulent foods. He was served by the
gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles,
who presented the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest
linen. Club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his
port, and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were
refreshingly cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the
American lakes.
If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed
that there is something good in eccentricity.
The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly
comfortable. The habits of its occupant were such as to demand
but little from the sole servant, but Phileas Fogg required him
to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular. On this very 2nd of
October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless
youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees
Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor,
who was due at the house between eleven and half-past eleven.
Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close
together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting
on his knees, his body straight, his head erect. He was steadily
watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, the
minutes, the seconds, the days, the months and the years. At
exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would, according to his daily
habit, quit Saville Row, and go to the Reform.
A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment
where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed
servant, appeared.
"The new servant," said he.
A young man of thirty advanced and bowed.
"You are a Frenchman, I believe," asked Phileas Fogg, "and your
name is John?"
"Jean, if monsieur pleases," replied the newcomer, Jean
Passepartout, a surname which has clung to me because I have a
natural aptness for going out of one business into another. I
believe I'm honest, monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I've had
several trades. I've been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider,
when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on a rope like
Blondin. Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as to
make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman
at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire. But I left France five
years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life,
took service as a valet here in England. Finding myself out of
place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact
and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to
monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and
forgetting even the name of Passepartout."
"Passepartout suits me," responded Mr. Fogg. "You are well
recommended to me. I hear a good report of you. You know my
conditions?"
"Yes, monsieur.
"Good! What time is it?"
"Twenty-two minutes after eleven," returned Passepartout,
drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.
"You are too slow," said Mr. Fogg.
"Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible -"
"You are four minutes too slow. No matter. It's enough to mention
the error. Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after
eleven, A.M., this Wednesday, the 2nd of October, you are in my
service."
Phileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his
head with an automatic motion, and went off without a word.
Passepartout heard the street door shut once. It was his new
master going out. He heard it shut again. It was his predecessor,
James Forster, departing in his turn. Passepartout remained alone
in the house in Saville Row.
Chapter 2
In Which Passepartout Is Convinced That He Has
at Last Found His Ideal
"Faith," muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, "I've seen
people at Madame Tussaud's as lively as my new master!"
Madame Tussaud's "people," let it be said, are of wax, and are
much visited in London. Speech is all that is wanting to make
them human.
During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been
carefully observing him. He appeared to be a man about forty
years of age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall,
well-shaped figure. His hair and whiskers were light, his
forehead compact and unwrinkled, his face rather pale, his teeth
magnificent. His countenance possessed in the highest degree what
physiognomists call "repose in action," a quality of those who
act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr.
Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which
Angelica Kauffmann has so skillfully represented on canvas. Seen
in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of
being perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy
chronometer. Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified,
and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and
feet; for in men, as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are
expressive of the passions.
He was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready,
and was economical alike of his steps and his motions. He never
took one step too many, and always went to his destination by the
shortest cut. He made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen
to be moved or agitated. He was the most deliberate person in the
world, yet always reached his destination at the exact moment.
He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social
relation; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken
of friction, and that friction retards, he never rubbed against
anybody.
As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since he
had abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a
valet, he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart.
Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by
Moliere, with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air. He
was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle
protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable, with a good round
head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend. His
eyes were blue, his complexion rosy, his figure full and
well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully
developed by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair
was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said
to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva's tresses,
Passepartout was familiar with but one way of fixing his own:
three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet.
It would be rash to predict how Passepartout's lively nature
would agree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the
new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master
required. Experience alone could solve the question. Passepartout
had been a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned
for repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he had
already served in ten English houses. But he could not take root
in any of these; with annoyance, he found his masters invariably
whimsical and irregular, constantly running about the country, or
on the lookout for adventure. His last master, young Lord
Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his nights in the
Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the morning on
policemen's shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting the
gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remark on such conduct;
but when it was ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr.
Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one
of unbroken regularity, that he neither traveled nor stayed from
home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was
after. He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.
At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in
the house in Saville Row. He began its inspection without delay,
scouring it from cellar to garret. So clean, well-arranged,
solemn a mansion pleased him. It seemed to him like a snail's
shell, lighted and warmed by gas, which sufficed for both these
purposes. When Passepartout reached the second story he
recognized at once the room which he was to inhabit, and he was
well satisfied with it. Electric bells and speaking-tubes
afforded communication with the lower stories. On the mantel
stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg's
bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant.
"That's good, that'll do," said Passepartout to himself.
He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon
inspection, proved to be a program of the daily routine of the
house. It comprised all that was required of the servant, from
eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose,
till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club
- all the details of service, the tea and toast at twenty-three
minutes past eight, the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes
past nine, and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten.
Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from
half-past eleven A.M. till midnight, the hour at which the
methodical gentleman retired.
Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was completely supplied and in the best
taste. Each pair of trousers, coat and vest bore a number,
indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn
to be laid out for wearing. The same system was applied to the
master's shoes. In short, the house in Saville Row, which must
have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the
illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness, comfort and
method idealized. There was no study, nor were there books, which
would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the Reform Club
two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law and
politics, were at his service. A moderate-sized safe stood in his
bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but
Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere.
Everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceful habits.
Having examined the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his
hands, a broad smile spread over his features, and he said
joyfully, "This is just what I wanted! Ah, we shall get on
together, Mr. Fogg and I! What a domestic and regular gentleman!
A real machine. Well, I don't mind serving a machine."
Chapter 3
In Which a Conversation Takes Place Which Seems
Likely to Cost Phileas Fogg Dearly
Phileas Fogg, having shut the door of his house at half-past
eleven, and having put his right foot before his left five
hundred and seventy-five times, and his left foot before his
right five hundred and seventy-six times, reached the Reform
Club, an imposing edifice in Pall Mall, which could not have cost
less than three millions.
He repaired at once to the dining-room, the nine windows of which
opened upon a tasteful garden, where the trees were already
gilded with an autumn coloring; and took his place at the
habitual table, the cover of which had already been laid for him.
His breakfast consisted of a side-dish, a broiled fish with
Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with
mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel of
Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of
tea, for which the Reform is famous.
He rose at thirteen minutes to one, and walked towards the large
hall, a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly framed
paintings. A porter handed him an uncut Times, which he proceeded
to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate
operation. The reading of this paper absorbed Phileas Fogg until
a quarter before four, while the Standard, his next task,
occupied him till the dinner hour. Dinner passed as breakfast had
done, and Mr. Fogg reappeared in the reading-room and sat down to
the Pall Mall at twenty minutes before six.
Half an hour later several members of the Reform Club came in and
drew up to the fireplace, where a coal fire was steadily burning.
They were Mr. Fogg's usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart, an
engineer; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas
Flanagan, a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of
the Bank of England - all rich and highly respectable persons,
even in a club which comprises the princes of English trade and
finance.
"Well, Ralph," said Thomas Flanagan, "what about that robbery?"
"Oh," replied Stuart, "the Bank will lose the money."
"On the contrary," broke in Ralph, "I hope we may put our hands
on the robber. Skillful detectives have been sent to all the
principal ports of America and the Continent, and he'll be a
clever fellow if he slips through their fingers."
"But have you got the robber's description?" asked Stuart.
"In the first place, he is no robber at all," returned Ralph,
positively.
"What! A fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds, no
robber?"
"No."
"Perhaps he's a manufacturer, then."
"The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman."
It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his
newspapers, who made this remark. He bowed to his friends, and
entered into the conversation. The affair which formed its
subject, and which was town talk, had occurred three days before
at the Bank of England. A package of banknotes, to the value of
fifty-five thousand pounds, had been taken from the principal
cashier's table, while he was engaged in registering the receipt
of three shillings and sixpence. Of course, he could not have his
eyes everywhere. Let it be observed that the Bank of England has
a touching confidence in the honesty of the public. There are
neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold,
silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first
comer. A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in
one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to
examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds. He took
it up, scrutinized it, passed it to his neighbor, he to the next
man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was
transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its
place for half an hour. Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as
raised his head. But in the present instance things had not gone
so smoothly. The package of notes not being found when five
o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the "drawing office,"
the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss. As soon
as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives hastened off to
Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York and other
ports, inspired by the promised reward of two thousand pounds,
and five per cent on the sum that might be recovered. Detectives
were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or
left London by rail, and a judicial examination was at once
entered upon.
There were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph
said, that the thief did not belong to a professional band. On
the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished
manners, and with a well-to-do air, had been observed going to
and fro in the paying-room, where the crime was committed. A
description of him was easily procured and sent to the
detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was one, did
not despair of his apprehension. The papers and clubs were full
of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing the
probabilities of a successful pursuit. The Reform Club was
especially agitated, several of its members being bank
officials.
Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was
likely to be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would
greatly stimulate their zeal and activity. But Stuart was far
from sharing this confidence; and, as they placed themselves at
the whist-table, they continued to argue the matter. Stuart and
Flanagan played together, while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for
his partner. As the game proceeded the conversation ceased,
excepting between the rubbers, when it revived again.
"I maintain," said Stuart, "that the chances are in favor of the
thief, who must be a shrewd fellow."
"Well, but where can he fly to?" asked Ralph. "No country is safe
for him."
"Pshaw!"
"Where could he go, then?"
"Oh, I don't know that. The world is big enough."
"It was once," said Phileas Fogg, in a low tone. "Cut, sir," he
added, handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan.
The discussion fell during the rubber, after which Stuart took up
its thread.
"What do you mean by 'once'? Has the world grown smaller?"
"Certainly," returned Ralph. "I agree with Mr. Fogg. The world
has grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more
quickly than a hundred years ago. And that is why the search for
this thief will be more likely to succeed."
"And also why the thief can get away more easily."
"Be so good as to play, Mr. Stuart," said Phileas Fogg.
But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand
was finished, he said eagerly: "You have a strange way, Ralph, of
proving that the world has grown smaller. So, because you can go
round it in three months -"
"In eighty days," interrupted Phileas Fogg.
"That is true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan. "Only eighty
days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the
Great Indian Peninsula Railway, has been opened. Here is the
estimate made by the Daily Telegraph:
From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and Brindisi by rail and
steamboats, 7 days
From Suez to Bombay, by steamer, 13 days
From Bombay to Calcutta, by rail, 3 days
From Calcutta to Hong Kong, by steamer, 13 days
From Hong Kong to Yokohama (Japan), by steamer, 6 days
From Yokohama to San Francisco, by steamer, 22 days
From San Francisco to New York, by rail, 7 days
From New York to London, by steamer and rail, 9 days
Total: 80 days"
"Yes, in eighty days!" exclaimed Stuart, who in his excitement
made a false deal. "But that doesn't take into account bad
weather, contrary winds, shipwrecks, railway accidents, and so
on."
"All included," returned Phileas Fogg, continuing to play despite
the discussion.
"But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails," replied
Stuart. "Suppose they stop the trains, pillage the luggage vans,
and scalp the passengers!"
"All included," calmly retorted Fogg; adding, as he threw down
the cards, "Two trumps."
Stuart, whose turn it was to deal, gathered them up, and went on:
"You are right, theoretically, Mr. Fogg, but practically -"
"Practically also, Mr. Stuart."
"I'd like to see you do it in eighty days."
"It depends on you. Shall we go?"
"Heaven preserve me! But I would wager four thousand pounds that
such a journey, made under these conditions, is impossible."
"Quite possible, on the contrary," returned Mr. Fogg.
"Well, make it, then!"
"The journey round the world in eighty days?"
"Yes."
"I should like nothing better."
"When?"
"At once. Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense.
"It's absurd!" cried Stuart, who was beginning to be annoyed at
the persistency of his friend. "Come, let's go on with the game."
"Deal over again, then," said Phileas Fogg. "There's a false
deal."
Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand. Then he suddenly
put them down again.
"Well, Mr. Fogg," said he, "it shall he so. I will wager the
four thousand on it."
"Calm yourself, my dear Stuart," said Fallentin. "It's only a joke."
"When I say I'll wager," returned Stuart, "I mean it."
"All right," said Mr. Fogg; and, turning to the others, he
continued: "I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring's which
I will willingly risk upon it."
"Twenty thousand pounds!" cried Sullivan. "Twenty thousand
pounds, which you would lose by a single accidental delay!"
"The unforeseen does not exist," quietly replied Phileas Fogg.
"But, Mr. Fogg, eighty days are only the estimate of the least
possible time in which the journey can he made."
"A well-used minimum suffices for everything."
"But, in order not to exceed it, you must jump mathematically
from the trains upon the steamers, and from the steamers upon the
trains again."
"I will jump - mathematically."
"You are joking."
"A true Englishman doesn't joke when he is talking about so
serious a thing as a wager," replied Phileas Fogg, solemnly. "I
will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I
will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in
nineteen hundred and twenty hours, or a hundred and fifteen
thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?"
"We accept," replied Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan,
Flanagan and Ralph, after consulting each other.
"Good," said Mr. Fogg. "The train leaves for Dover at a quarter
before nine. I will take it."
"This very evening?" asked Stuart.
"This very evening," returned Phileas Fogg. He took out and
consulted a pocket almanac, and added, "As today is Wednesday,
the 2nd of October, I shall he due in London, in this very room
of the Reform Club, on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a
quarter before nine P.M.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now
deposited in my name at Baring's, will belong to you, in fact and
in right, gentlemen. Here is a check for the amount."
A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the
six parties, during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical
composure. He certainly did not bet to win, and had only staked
the twenty thousand pounds, half of his fortune, because he
foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out
this difficult, not to say unattainable, project. As for his
antagonists, they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value
of their stake, as because they had some scruples about betting
under conditions so difficult to their friend.
The clock struck seven, and the party offered to suspend the game
so that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure.
"I am quite ready now," was his tranquil response. "Diamonds are
trumps. Be so good as to play, gentlemen."
Chapter 4
In Which Phileas Fogg Astounds Passepartout
Having won twenty guineas at whist, and taken leave of his
friends, Phileas Fogg, at twenty-five minutes past seven, left
the Reform Club.
Passepartout, who had conscientiously studied the program of his
duties, was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the
inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour. According to
rule, he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight.
Mr. Fogg went to his bedroom, and called out, "Passepartout!"
Passepartout did not reply. It could not be he who was called. It
was not the right hour.
"Passepartout!" repeated Mr. Fogg, without raising his voice.
Passepartout made his appearance.
"I've called you twice," observed his master.
"But it is not midnight," responded the other, showing his watch.
"I know it. I don't blame you. We start for Dover and Calais in
ten minutes."
A puzzled grin spread over Passepartout's round face. Clearly he
had not comprehended his master.
"Monsieur is going to leave home?"
"Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world."
Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up
his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with
stupefied astonishment.
"Round the world!" he murmured.
"In eighty days?" responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to
lose."
"But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his
head from right to left.
"We'll have no trunks. Only a carpetbag, with two shirts and
three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We'll buy
our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and
traveling-cloak, and some stout shoes, though we shall do little
walking. Make haste!"
Passepartout tried to reply, but could not. He went out, mounted
to his own room, fell into a chair, and muttered: "That's good,
that is! And I, who wanted to remain quiet!"
He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure.
Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was
this a joke, then? They were going to Dover. Good! To Calais.
Good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from
France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native
soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would
do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But surely a gentleman
so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt - but, then, it
was none the less true that he was going away, this former
homebody.
By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpetbag,
containing the wardrobes of his master and himself. Then, still
troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and
descended to Mr. Fogg.
Mr. Fogg was quite ready. Under his arm might have been observed
a red-bound copy of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Steam Transit
and General Guide, with its timetables showing the arrival and
departure of steamers and railways. He took the carpetbag, opened
it, and slipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes,
which would pass wherever he might go.
"You have forgotten nothing?" he asked.
"Nothing, monsieur."
"My mackintosh and cloak?"
"Here they are.
"Good! Take this carpetbag," handing it to Passepartout. "Take
good care of it, for there are twenty thousand pounds in it."
Passepartout nearly dropped the bag, as if the twenty thousand
pounds were in gold, and weighed him down.
Master and man then descended, the street door was double-locked,
and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly
to Charing Cross. The cab stopped before the railway station at
twenty minutes past eight. Passepartout jumped off the box and
followed his master, who, after paying the cabman, was about to
enter the station, when a poor beggar woman, with a child in her
arms, approached him. Her naked feet were smeared with mud, her
head covered with a wretched bonnet, from which hung a tattered
feather, and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl. She
mournfully asked for alms.
Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist,
and handed them to the beggar, saying, "Here, my good woman. I'm
glad that I met you"; and passed on.
Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes. His master's
action touched his susceptible heart.
Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased,
Mr. Fogg was Crossing the station to the train, when he perceived
his five friends of the Reform Club.
"Well, gentlemen," he said, "I'm off, you see; and, if you will
examine my passport when I get back, you will be able to judge
whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon."
"Oh, that would be quite unnecessary, Mr. Fogg," said Ralph
politely. "We will trust your word, as a gentleman of honor."
"You do not forget when you are due in London again?" asked
Stuart. "In eighty days. On Saturday, the 21st of December, 1872,
at a quarter before nine P.M. Good-by, gentlemen."
Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class
carriage at twenty minutes before nine. Five minutes later the
whistle screamed, and the train slowly glided out of the station.
The night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling. Phileas
Fogg, leaning back in his corner, did not open his lips.
Passepartout, not yet recovered from his stupefaction, clung
mechanically to the carpetbag, with its enormous treasure.
Just as the train was whirling through Sydenham, Passepartout
suddenly uttered a cry of despair.
"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"Alas! In my hurry - I - I forgot-"
"What?"
"To turn off the gas in my room!"
"Very well, young man," returned Mr. Fogg, coolly,
"it will burn - at your expense."
Chapter 5
In Which a New Security Appears on the London Exchange
Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London
would create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the
bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting
topic of conversation to its members. From the club it soon got
into the papers throughout England. The boasted "tour of the
world" was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as
if the subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with
Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and
declared against him. It was absurd, impossible, they declared,
that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically
and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing
means of traveling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post and Daily
News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr.
Fogg's project as madness. The Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly
supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and
blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which
betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.
Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the
question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the
English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were
eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash
individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause,
which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News
came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the
Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to
say, "Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass."
At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the
bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the
question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter
folly of the enterprise.
Everything, it said, was against the travelers, every obstacle
imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the
times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was
absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on
the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where
the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated
upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in
seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his
task? There were accidents to machinery, the liability of trains
to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the blocking up by
snow - were not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would he not find
himself, when traveling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of the
winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be
two or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice
to fatally break the chain of communication. Should Phileas Fogg
once miss, even by an hour, a steamer, he would have to wait
for the next, and that would irrevocably render his attempt
vain.
This article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into
all the papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash
tourist.
Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men, who are
of a higher class than mere gamblers. To bet is in the English
temperament. Not only the members of the Reform, but the general
public, made heavy wagers for or against Phileas Fogg, who was
set down in the betting books as if he were a race horse. Bonds
were issued, and made their appearance on the Exchange. "Phileas
Fogg bonds" were offered at par or at a premium, and a great
business was done in them. But five days after the article in the
bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the demand began
to subside. "Phileas Fogg" declined. They were offered by
packages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last nobody
would take less than twenty, fifty, a hundred!
Lord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only
advocate of Phileas Fogg left. This noble lord, who was confined
to his chair, would have given his fortune to be able to make the
tour of the world, if it took ten years; and he bet five
thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg. When the folly as well as the
uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him, he
contented himself with replying, "If the thing is feasible, the
first to do it ought to be an Englishman."
The Fogg party dwindled more and more. Everybody was going
against him, and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two
hundred to one; and a week after his departure an incident
occurred which deprived him of backers at any price.
The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine
o'clock one evening, when the following telegraphic despatch was
put into his hands:
Suez to London
ROWAN, COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, SCOTLAND YARD:
I've found the bank robber, Phileas Fogg. Send without delay
warrant of arrest to Bombay. FIX, Detective
The effect of this despatch was instantaneous. The polished
gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber. His
photograph, which was hung with those of the rest of the members
of the Reform Club, was minutely examined, and it betrayed,
feature by feature, the description of the robber which had been
provided to the police. The mysterious habits of Phileas Fogg
were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden departure; and it
seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the world on the
pretext of a wager, he had had no other end in view than to elude
the detectives, and throw them off his track.
Chapter 6
In Which Fix, the Detective, Betrays a Very Natural Impatience
The circumstances under which this telegraphic despatch about
Phileas Fogg was sent were as follows:
The steamer Mongolia, belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental
Company, built of iron, of two thousand eight hundred tons
burden, and five hundred horsepower, was due at eleven o'clock
A.M. on Wednesday, the 9th of October, at Suez. The Mongolia
plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal,
and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company,
always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and
Suez, and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay.
Two men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the crowd
of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once
straggling village - now, thanks to the enterprise of M.
Lesseps, a fast-growing town. One was the British consul at Suez,
who, despite the prophecies of the English Government, and the
unfavorable predictions of Stephenson, was in the habit of
seeing, from his office window, English ships daily passing to
and fro on the great canal, by which the old roundabout route
from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was cut by at
least a half. The other was a small, slight-built person, with a
nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under
eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching. He was just now
manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing up
and down, and unable to stand still for a moment. This was Fix,
one of the detectives who had been despatched from England in
search of the bank robber. It was his task to narrowly watch
every passenger who arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who
seemed to be suspicious characters, or bore a resemblance to the
description of the criminal, which he had received two days
before from the police headquarters at London. The detective was
evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward
which would be the prize of success, and awaited with a feverish
impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of the steamer
Mongolia.
"So you say, consul," he asked for the twentieth time, "that this
steamer is never behind time?"
"No, Mr. Fix," replied the consul. "She was signaled yesterday at
Port Said, and the rest of the way is of no account to such a
craft. I repeat that the Mongolia has been in advance of the time
required by the company's regulations, and gained the prize
awarded for excess of speed."
"Does she come directly from Brindisi?"
"Directly from Brindisi. She takes on the Indian mails there, and
she left there Saturday at five P.M. Have patience, Mr. Fix. She
will not be late. But really, I don't see how, from the
description you have, you will be able to recognize your man,
even if he is on board the Mongolia."
"A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, than
recognizes them. You must have a scent for them, and a scent is
like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling.
I've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and,
if my thief is on board, I'll answer for it. He'll not slip
through my fingers."
"I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery."
"A magnificent robbery, consul. Fifty-five thousand pounds! We
don't often have such windfalls. Burglars are getting to be so
contemptible nowadays! A fellow gets hung for a handful of
shillings!"
"Mr. Fix," said the consul, "I like your way of talking, and hope
you'll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy. Don't
you see, the description which you have there has a singular
resemblance to an honest man?"
"Consul," remarked the detective, dogmatically, "great robbers
always resemble honest folks. Fellows who have rascally faces
have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest;
otherwise they would be arrested offhand. The artistic thing is
to unmask honest countenances. It's no light task, I admit, but a
real art."
Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.
Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated.
Sailors of various nations, merchants, ship-brokers, porters,
fellahs, bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately
expected. The weather was clear, and slightly chilly. The
minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of
the sun. A jetty pier, some two thousand yards along, extended
into the roadstead. A number of fishing smacks and coasting
boats, some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys,
were discernible on the Red Sea.
As he passed among the busy crowd, Fix, according to habit,
scrutinized the passers-by with a keen, rapid glance.
It was now half-past ten.
"The steamer doesn't come!" he exclaimed, as the port clock
struck.
"She can't be far off now," returned his companion.
"How long will she stop at Suez?"
"Four hours. Long enough to get in her coal. It is thirteen
hundred and ten miles from Suez to Aden, at the other end of the
Red Sea, and she has to take in a fresh coal supply."
"And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay?"
"Without putting in anywhere."
"Good!" said Fix. "If the robber is on board he will no doubt get
off at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies
in Asia by some other route. He ought to know that he would not
be safe an hour in India, which is English soil."
"Unless," objected the consul, "he is exceptionally shrewd. An
English criminal, you know, is always better concealed in London
than anywhere else."
This observation furnished the detective food for thought, and
meanwhile the consul went away to his office. Fix, left alone,
was more impatient than ever, having a presentiment that the
robber was on board the Mongolia. If he had indeed left London
intending to reach the New World, he would naturally take the
route via India, which was less watched and more difficult to
watch than that of the Atlantic. But Fix's reflections were soon
interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles, which announced
the arrival of the Mongolia. The porters and fellahs rushed down
the quay, and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and
meet the steamer. Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along
between the banks, and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in
the road. She brought an unusual number of passengers, some of
whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the
town, while the greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed
on the quay.
Fix took up a position, and carefully examined each face and
figure which made its appearance. Presently one of the
passengers, after vigorously pushing his way through the
importunate crowd of porters, came up to him and politely asked
if he could point out the English consulate, at the same time
showing a passport which he wished to have visaed. Fix
instinctively took the passport, and with a rapid glance read the
description of its bearer. An involuntary motion of surprise
nearly escaped him, for the description in the passport was
identical with that of the hank robber which he had received from
Scotland Yard.
"Is this your passport?" he asked.
"No, it's my master's."
"And your master is -"
"He stayed on board."
"But he must go to the consul's in person, so as to establish his
identity."
"Oh, is that necessary?"
"Quite indispensable."
"And where is the consulate?"
"There, on the corner of the square," said Fix, pointing to a
house two hundred steps off.
"I'll go and fetch my master, who won't be much pleased, however,
to be disturbed."
The passenger bowed to Fix, and returned to the steamer.
Chapter 7
Which Once More Demonstrates the Uselessness
of Passports as Aids to Detectives
The detective passed down the quay, and rapidly made his way to
the consul's office, where he was at once admitted to the
presence of that official.
"Consul," he said, without preamble, "I have strong reasons for
believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia." And he
narrated what had just passed concerning the passport.
"Well, Mr. Fix," replied the consul, "I shall not be sorry to see
the rascal's face, but perhaps he won't come here - that is, if
he is the person you suppose him to be. A robber doesn't quite
like to leave traces of his flight behind him; and, besides, he
is not obliged to have his passport countersigned."
"If he is as shrewd as I think he is, consul, he will come."
"To have his passport visaed?"
"Yes. Passports are only good for annoying honest folks, and
aiding in the flight of rogues. I assure you it will be quite the
thing for him to do; but I hope you will not visa the passport."
"Why not? If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse."
"Still, I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to
arrest him from London."
"Ah, that's your look-out. But I cannot -"
The consul did not finish his sentence, for as he spoke a knock
was heard at the door, and two strangers entered, one of whom was
the servant whom Fix had met on the quay. The other, who was his
master, held out his passport with the request that the consul
would do him the favor to visa it. The consul took the document
and carefully read it, while Fix observed, or rather devoured,
the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room.
"You are Mr. Phileas Fogg?" said the consul, after reading the
passport.
"I am."
"And this man is your servant?"
"He is, a Frenchman, named Passepartout."
"You are from London?"
"Yes."
"And you are going -"
"To Bombay."
"Very good, sir. You know that a visa is useless, and that no
passport is required?"
"I know it, sir," replied Phileas Fogg, "but I wish to prove, by
your visa, that I came by Suez."
"Very well, sir."
The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport, after which
he added his official seal. Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee,
coldly bowed, and went out, followed by his servant.
"Well?" queried the detective.
"Well, he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man," replied
the consul.
"Possibly; but that is not the question. Do you think, consul,
that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles, feature by feature, the
robber whose description I have received?"
"I concede that, but then, you know, all descriptions -"
"I'll make certain of it," interrupted Fix. "The servant seems to
me less mysterious than the master; besides, he's a Frenchman,
and can't help talking. Excuse me for a little while, consul."
Fix started off in search of Passepartout.
Meanwhile Mr. Fogg, after leaving the consulate, repaired to the
quay, gave some orders to Passepartout, went off to the Mongolia
in a boat, and descended to his cabin. He took up his notebook,
which contained the following memoranda:
"Left London, Wednesday, October 2nd, at 8:45 P.M.
"Reached Paris, Thursday, October 3rd, at 7:20 A.M.
"Left Paris, Thursday, at 8:40 A.M.
"Reached Turin by Mont Cenis, Friday, October 4th, at 6:35 AM.
"Left Turin, Friday, at 7:20 A.M.
"Arrived at Brindisi, Saturday, October 5th, at 4 P.M.
"Sailed on the Mongolia, Saturday, at 5 P.M.
"Reached Suez, Wednesday, October 9th, at 11 A.M.
"Total of hours spent, 158-1/2; or, in days, six days and a half."
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns,
indicating the month, the day of the month, and the day for the
stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point - Paris,
Brindisi, Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Yokohama,
San Francisco, New York and London - from the 2nd of October to
the 21st of December; and giving a space for setting down the
gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality. This
methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed,
and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind or in advance of
his time. On this Friday, October 9th, he noted his arrival at
Suez, and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost. He
sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin, never once thinking
of inspecting the town, being one of those Englishmen who are
wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their servants.
Chapter 8
In Which Passepartout Talks Rather More,
Perhaps, than Is Prudent
Fix soon rejoined Passepartout, who was lounging and looking
about on the quay, as if he did not feel that he, at least, was
obliged not to see anything.
"Well, my friend," said the detective, coming up with him, "is
your passport visaed?"
"Ah, it's you, is it, monsieur?" responded Passepartout.
"Thanks, yes, the passport is all right."
"And you are looking about you?"
"Yes, but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a
dream. So this is Suez?"
"Yes."
"In Egypt?"
"Certainly, in Egypt."
"And in Africa?"
"In Africa."
"In Africa!" repeated Passepartout. "Just think, monsieur, I had
no idea that we should go farther than Paris; and all that I saw
of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes
before nine in the morning, between the Northern and the Lyons
stations, through the windows of a car, and in a driving rain!
How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the
circus in the Champs Elysees!"
"You are in a great hurry, then?"
"I am not, but my master is. By the way, I must buy some shoes
and shirts. We came away without trunks, only with a carpetbag."
"I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you
want."
"Really, monsieur, you are very kind."
And they walked off together, Passepartout chatting volubly as
they went along.
"Above all," he said; "don't let me lose the steamer."
"You have plenty of time. It's only twelve o'clock."
Passepartout pulled out his big watch. "Twelve!" he exclaimed.
"Why, it's only eight minutes before ten."
"Your watch is slow."
"My watch? A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my
great-grandfather! It doesn't vary five minutes in the year. It's
a perfect chronometer, look you.
"I see how it is," said Fix. "You have kept London time, which is
two hours behind that of Suez. You ought to regulate your watch
at noon in each country."
"I regulate my watch? Never!"
"Well, then, it will not agree with the sun."
"So much the worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong,
then!"
And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a
defiant gesture. After a few minutes' silence, Fix resumed: "You
left London hastily, then?"
"I rather think so! Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening,
Monsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an
hour afterwards we were off."
"But where is your master going?"
"Always straight ahead. He is going round the world."
"Round the world?" cried Fix.
"Yes, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager; but, between
us, I don't believe a word of it. That wouldn't be common sense.
There's something else in the wind."
"Ah! Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?"
"I should say he was."
"Is he rich?"
"No doubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in
brand-new banknotes with him. And he doesn't spare the money on
the way, either. He has offered a large reward to the engineer
of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time."
"And you have known your master a long time?"
"Why, no; I entered his service the very day we left London."
The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and
excited detective may be imagined. The hasty departure from
London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg;
his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an
eccentric and foolhardy bet - all confirmed Fix in his theory. He
continued to pump poor Passepartout, and learned that he really
knew little or nothing of his master, who lived a solitary
existence in London, was said to be rich, though no one knew from
where his riches came, and was mysterious and impenetrable in his
affairs and habits. Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not
land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay.
"Is Bombay far from here?" asked Passepartout.
"Pretty far. It is a ten days' voyage by sea."
"And in what country is Bombay?"
"India."
"In Asia?"
"Certainly."
"The deuce! I was going to tell you - there's one thing that
worries me - my burner!"
"What burner?"
"My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off, and which is at this
moment burning - at my expense. I have calculated, monsieur, that
I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours, exactly
sixpence more than I earn; and you will understand that the
longer our journey -"
Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout's trouble about the
gas? It is not probable. He was not listening, but was cogitating
a project. Passepartout and he had now reached the shop where
Fix left his companion to make his purchases, after recommending
him not to miss the steamer, and hurried back to the
consulate. Now that he was fully convinced, Fix had quite
recovered his equanimity.
"Consul," said he, "I have no longer any doubt. I have spotted my
man. He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the
world in eighty days."
"Then he's a sharp fellow," returned the consul, "and counts on
returning to London after putting the police of the two countries
off his track."
"We'll see about that," replied Fix.
"But are you not mistaken?"
"I am not mistaken."
"Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the visa, that he
had passed through Suez?"
"Why? I have no idea; but listen to me."
He reported in a few words the most important parts of his
conversation with Passepartout.
"In short," said the consul, "appearances are wholly against this
man. And what are you going to do?"
"Send a despatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be
despatched instantly to Bombay, take passage on board the
Mongolia, follow my rogue to India, and there, on English ground,
arrest him politely, with my warrant in my hand, and my hand on
his shoulder."
Having uttered these words with a cool, careless air, the
detective took leave of the consul, and repaired to the telegraph
office, where he sent the despatch which we have seen to the
London police office. A quarter of an hour later found Fix, with
a small bag in his hand, proceeding on board the Mongolia; and,
before many more moments, the noble steamer rode out at full
steam upon the waters of the Red Sea.
Chapter 9
In Which the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean Prove
Propitious to the Designs of Phileas Fogg
The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred
and ten miles, and the regulations of the company allow the
steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse
it. The Mongolia, thanks to the vigorous exertions of the
engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her
destination considerably within that time. The greater part of
the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India - some for
Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route
there, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula.
Among the passengers was a number of officials and military
officers of various grades, the latter being either attached to
the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops, and
receiving high salaries ever since the central government has
assumed the powers of the East India Company.
What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on
their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time
passed quickly on the Mongolia. The best of fare was spread upon
the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner and the eight
o'clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their attire
twice a day. The hours were whirled away, when the sea was
tranquil, with music, dancing and games.
But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like
most long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African
or Asian coast the Mongolia, with her long hull, rolled
fearfully. Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos
were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good
ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards
the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. What was Phileas Fogg doing all
this time? It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be
constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly
raging of the billows - every change, in short, which might force
the Mongolia to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his
journey. But, if he thought of these possibilities, he did not
betray the fact by any outward sign.
Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club, whom no
incident could surprise, as unvarying as the ship's chronometers,
and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck, he
passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold
indifference. He did not care to recognize the historic towns and
villages which, along its borders, raised their picturesque
outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of
the Arabic Gulf, which the old historians always spoke of with
horror, and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured
without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices. How did this
eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia? He made his
four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent
rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played
whist indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in
the game as himself. A tax-collector, on the way to his post at
Goa; the Rev. Decimus Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay;
and a brigadier-general of the English army, who was about to
rejoin his brigade at Benares, made up the party, and, with Mr.
Fogg, played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence.
As for Passepartout, he, too, had escaped seasickness, and took
his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin. He rather enjoyed
the voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took a great
interest in the scenes through which they were passing, and
consoled himself with the delusion that his master's whim would
end at Bombay. He was pleased, on the day after leaving Suez, to
find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and
chatted on the quays.
"If I am not mistaken," he said, approaching this person, with
his most amiable smile, "you are the gentleman who so kindly
volunteered to guide me at Suez?"
"Ah! I quite recognize you. You are the servant of the strange
Englishman -"
"Just so, monsieur -"
"Fix."
"Monsieur Fix," resumed Passepartout. "I'm charmed to find you on
board. Where are you bound?"
"Like you, to Bombay."
"That's capital! Have you made this trip before?"
"Several times. I am one of the agents of the Peninsular
Company."
"Then you know India?"
"Why - yes," replied Fix, who spoke cautiously.
"A curious place, this India?"
"Oh, very curious. Mosques, minarets, temples, fakirs, pagodas,
tigers, snakes, elephants! I hope you will have ample time to see
the sights."
"I hope so, Monsieur Fix. You see, a man of sound sense ought not
to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train,
and from a railway train upon a steamer again, pretending to make
the tour of the world in eighty days! No, all these gymnastics,
you may be sure, will cease at Bombay."
"And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?" asked Fix, in the most natural
tone in the world.
"Quite well, and I too. I eat like a famished ogre. It's the sea
air.
"But I never see your master on deck."
"Never. He hasn't the least curiosity."
"Do you know, Mr. Passepartout, that this pretended tour in
eighty days may conceal some secret errand - perhaps a
diplomatic mission?"
"Faith, Monsieur Fix, I assure you I know nothing about it, nor
would I give half a crown to find out."
After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of
chatting together, the latter making it a point to gain the
worthy man's confidence. He frequently offered him a glass of
whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room, which Passepartout
never failed to accept with graceful alacrity, mentally
pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows.
Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly. On the 13th,
Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls where date-trees were
growing, was sighted, and on the mountains beyond vast
coffee-fields were seen. Passepartout was ravished to behold this
celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and
dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer.
The following night they passed through the Strait of
Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic "The Bridge of Tears," and
the next day they put in at Steamer Point, northwest of Aden
harbor, to take in coal. This matter of fueling steamers is a
serious one at such distances from the coal-mines. It costs the
Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year. In
these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a
ton.
The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to
traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four
hours at Steamer Point to coal up. But this delay, as it was
foreseen, did not affect Phileas Fogg's program; besides, the
Mongolia, instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th,
when she was due, arrived there on the evening of the 14th, a
gain of fifteen hours.
Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the
passport again visaed. Fix, unobserved, followed them. The visa
procured, Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits;
while Passepartout, according to custom, sauntered about among
the mixed population of Somanlis, Banyas, Parsees, Jews, Arabs
and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants
of Aden. He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make
this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean, and the vast
cisterns where the English engineers were still at work, two
thousand years after the engineers of Solomon.
"Very curious, very curious," said Passepartout to himself, on
returning to the steamer. "I see that it is by no means useless
to travel, if a man wants to see something new."
At six P.M. the Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead, and
was soon once more on the Indian Ocean. She had a hundred and
sixty-eight hours in which to reach Bombay, and the sea was
favorable, the wind being in the north-west, and all sails aiding
the engine. The steamer rolled but little; the ladies, in fresh
dresses, reappeared on deck; and the singing and dancing were
resumed. The trip was being accomplished most successfully, and
Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which
chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix.
On Sunday, October 20th, towards noon, they came in sight of the
Indian coast. Two hours later the pilot came on board. A range of
hills lay against the sky in the horizon, and soon the rows of
palms which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view. The steamer
entered the road formed by the islands in the bay, and at
half-past four she hauled up at the quays of Bombay.
Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber
of the voyage, and his partner and himself having, by a bold
stroke, captured all thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine
campaign with a brilliant victory.
The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on the
20th. This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his
departure from London, and he calmly entered the fact in the
itinerary, in the column of gains.
Chapter 10
In Which Passepartout Is Only Too Glad
to Get off with the Loss of His Shoes
Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with
its base in the north and its apex in the south, which is called
India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon
which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty
millions of souls. The British Crown exercises a real and
despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country,
and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta, governors at
Madras, Bombay and in Bengal, and a lieutenant-governor at Agra.
But British India, properly so called, only embraces seven
hundred thousand square miles, and a population of from one
hundred to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants. A
considerable portion of India is still free from British
authority; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior
who are absolutely independent. The celebrated East India Company
was all-powerful from 1756, when the English first gained a
foothold on the spot where now stands the city of Madras, down to
the time of the great Sepoy insurrection. It gradually annexed
province after province, purchasing them of the native chiefs,
whom it seldom paid, and appointed the governor-general and his
subordinates, civil and military. But the East India Company has
now passed away, leaving the British possessions in India
directly under the control of the Crown. The aspect of the
country, as well as the manners and distinctions of race, is
daily changing.
Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old unwieldy
methods of going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or
unwieldy coaches. Now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the
Ganges, and a great railway, with branch lines joining the main
line at many points on its route, traverses the peninsula from
Bombay to Calcutta in three days. This railway does not run in a
direct line across India. The distance between Bombay and
Calcutta, as the bird flies, is only from one thousand to eleven
hundred miles; but the deflections of the road increase this
distance by more than a third.
The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as
follows: Leaving Bombay, it passes through Salcette, crossing to
the continent opposite Tannah, goes over the chain of the Western
Ghauts, runs thence northeast as far as Burhampoor, skirts the
nearly independent territory of Bundelcund, ascends to
Allahabad, turns towards the east, meeting the Ganges at Benares,
then departs from the river a little, and, descending
southeastward by Burdivan and the French town of Chandernagor,
ends at Calcutta.
The passengers of the Mongolia went ashore at half-past four P.M.
At exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta.
Mr. Fogg, after bidding good-by to his whist partners, left the
steamer, gave his servant several errands to do, urged it upon
him to be at the station promptly at eight, and, with his
regular step, which beat to the second, like an astronomical
clock, directed his steps to the passport office. As for
the wonders of Bombay - its famous city hall, its splendid
library, its forts and docks, its bazaars, mosques, synagogues,
its Armenian churches and the noble pagoda on Malabar Hill, with
its two polygonal towers - he cared not a straw to see them. He
would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta, or
the mysterious hypogea, concealed southeast from the docks, or
those fine remains of Buddhist architecture, the Kanherian
grottoes of the island of Salcette.
Having transacted his business at the passport office, Phileas
Fogg repaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered
dinner. Among the dishes served up to him, the landlord
especially recommended a certain giblet of "native rabbit," on
which he prided himself.
Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but, despite its spiced
sauce, found it far from palatable. He rang for the landlord,
and, on his appearance, said, fixing his clear eyes upon him, "Is
this rabbit, Sir?"
"Yes, my lord," the rogue boldly replied, "rabbit from the
jungles."
"And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?"
"Mew, my lord! What, a rabbit mew! I swear to you -"
"Be so good, landlord, as not to swear, but remember this: cats
were formerly considered, in India, as sacred animals. That was a
good time."
"For the cats, my lord?"
"Perhaps for the travelers as well."
After which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner.
Meanwhile Fix had gone on shore shortly after Mr. Fogg, and his
first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police. He
made himself known as a London detective, told his business at
Bombay, and the position of affairs relative to the supposed
robber, and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London.
It had not reached the office; indeed, there had not yet been
time for it to arrive. Fix was very disappointed, and tried to
obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police.
But the director refused, as the matter concerned the London
office, which alone could legally deliver the warrant. Fix did
not insist, and resigned himself to await the arrival of the
important document. But he was determined not to lose sight of
the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay. He did not
doubt for a moment, any more than Passepartout, that Phileas
Fogg would remain there, at least until it was time for the
warrant to arrive.
Passepartout, however, had no sooner heard his master's orders on
leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave
Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris, and that the journey
would be extended at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps beyond
that place. He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg
talked about was not really in good earnest, and whether his fate
was not in truth forcing him, despite his love of repose, around
the world in eighty days!
Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a
leisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people of
many nationalities -Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, Banyas
with round turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees with
black mitres and long-robed Armenians - were collected. It
happened to be the day of a Parsee festival. These descendants of
the sect of Zoroaster - the most thrifty, civilized, intelligent
and austere of the East Indians, among whom are counted the
richest native merchants of Bombay - were celebrating a sort of
religious carnival, with processions and shows, in the midst of
which Indian dancing-girls, clothed in rose-colored gauze, looped
up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect modesty,
to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines. It is
needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious
ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his
countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable.
Unhappily for his master, as well as himself, his curiosity drew
him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go. At last,
having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was
turning his steps towards the station, when he happened to see
the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill, and was seized with an
irresistible desire to view its interior. He was quite ignorant
that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian
temples, and that even the faithful must not go in without first
leaving their shoes outside the door. It may he said here that
the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a
disregard of the practices of the native religions.
Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple
tourist, and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin
ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes, when suddenly he
found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up to
behold three enraged priests, who fell upon him, tore off his
shoes and began to beat him with loud, savage exclamations. The
agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again, and lost no time in
knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists
and vigorous kicks. Then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as
his legs could carry him, he escaped the third priest by mingling
with the crowd in the streets.
At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless,
and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts
and shoes, rushed breathlessly into the station.
Fix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he
was really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform.
He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and
farther, if necessary. Passepartout did not observe the
detective, who stood in an obscure corner; but Fix heard him
relate his adventures in a few words to Mr. Fogg.
"I hope that this will not happen again," said Phileas Fogg
coldly, as he got into the train. Poor Passepartout, quite
crest-fallen, followed his master without a word. Fix was on the
point of entering another carriage, when an idea struck him which
induced him to alter his plan.
"No, I'll stay," muttered he. "An offence has been committed on
Indian soil. I've got my man."
Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech, and the train
passed out into the darkness of the night.
Chapter 11
In Which Phileas Fogg Buys a Curious
Means of Conveyance at a Fabulous Price
The train had started punctually. Among the passengers were a
number of officers, Government officials, and opium and indigo
merchants, whose business called them to the eastern coast.
Passepartout rode in the same carriage with his master, and a
third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them. This was
Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg's whist partners on the
Mongolia, now on his way to join his corps at Benares.
Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly
distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt. He made India his
home, only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and
was almost as familiar as a native with the customs, history and
character of India and its people. But Phileas Fogg, who was not
traveling, but only describing a circumference, took no pains to
inquire into these subjects. He was a solid body, traversing an
orbit around the terrestrial globe, according to the laws of
rational mechanics. He was at this moment calculating in his mind
the number of hours spent since his departure from London, and,
had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration, would
have rubbed his hands for satisfaction.
Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his traveling
companion - although the only opportunity he had for studying him
had been while he was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers
- and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat
beneath this cold exterior, and whether Phileas Fogg had any
sense of the beauties of nature. The brigadier-general was free
to mentally confess that, of all the eccentric persons he had
ever met, none was comparable to this product of the exact
sciences.
Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of
going round the world, nor the circumstances under which he set
out; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity
and a lack of sound common sense. In the way this strange
gentleman was going on, he would leave the world without having
done any good to himself or anybody else.
An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts
and the Island of Salcette, and had traveled into the open
country. At Callyan they reached the junction of the branch line
which descends towards southeastern India by Kandallah and
Pounah; and, passing Pauwell, they entered the defiles of the
mountains, with their basalt bases, and their summits crowned
with thick and verdant forests. Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis
Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time, and now Sir
Francis, reviving the conversation, observed, "Some years ago,
Mr. Fogg, you would have met with a delay at this point which
would probably have lost you your wager."
"How so, Sir Francis?"
"Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, and
the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies
to Kandallah, on the other side."
"Such a delay would not have spoiled my plans in the least," said
Mr. Fogg. "I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of
certain obstacles."
"But, Mr. Fogg," pursued Sir Francis, "you run the risk of having
some difficulty about this worthy fellow's adventure at the
pagoda." Passepartout, his feet comfortably wrapped in his
traveling blanket, was sound asleep and did not dream that
anybody was talking about him. "The Government is very severe
about that kind of offence. It takes particular care that the
religious customs of the Indians should be respected, and if your
servant were caught -"
"Very well, Sir Francis," replied Mr. Fogg; "if he had been
caught he would have been condemned and punished,
and then would have quietly returned to Europe. I don't
see how this affair could have delayed his master."
The conversation fell again. During the night the train left the
mountains behind, and passed Nassik, and the next day proceeded
over the flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish, with its
straggling villages, above which rose the minarets of the
pagodas. This fertile territory is watered by numerous small
rivers and limpid streams, mostly tributaries of the Godavery.
Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realize that
he was actually crossing India in a railway train. The
locomotive, guided by an English engineer and fed with English
coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove and
pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around
groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which were seen
picturesque bungalows, viharis (like abandoned monasteries) and
marvelous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of
Indian architecture.
Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, with
jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise
of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and
still haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at the
train as it passed. The travelers crossed, beyond Milligaum, the
fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the
goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas,
and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb,
now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the
kingdom of the Nizam. It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the
Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These
ruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age
in honor of the goddess Death, without ever shedding blood. There
was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be
traveled over without corpses being found in every direction. The
English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these
murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise
of their horrible rites.
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where
Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers,
ornamented with false pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he
proceeded to encase his feet. The travelers made a hasty
breakfast and started off for Assurghur, after skirting for a
little the banks of the small river Tapty, which empties into the
Gulf of Cambray, near Surat.
Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie. Up to his
arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey
would end there; but, now that they were plainly whirling across
India at full speed, a sudden change had come over the spirit of
his dreams. His old vagabond nature returned to him. The
fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him. He
came to regard his master's project as intended in good earnest,
believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of
the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the
designated period. Already he began to worry about possible
delays, and accidents which might happen on the way. He
recognized himself as being personally interested in the wager,
and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of
losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before. Being
much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless,
counting and recounting the days passed over, uttering
maledictions when the train stopped, and accusing it of
sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed
the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was
possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could
not be done on the railway.
The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which
separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next
day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to
which, on consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in
the morning. This famous timepiece, always regulated on the
Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees
westward, was at least four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected
Passepartout's time. But Passepartout made the same remark that
he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch
should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was constantly
going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and therefore the
days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over,
Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he
kept at London time. It was an innocent delusion which could harm
no one.
The train stopped at eight o'clock in the midst of a glade some
fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows,
and workmen's cabins. The conductor, passing along the
carriages, shouted, "Passengers will get out here!"
Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation;
but the general did not know why a halt had been called in the
midst of this forest of dates and acacias.
Passepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily
returned, crying: "Monsieur, no more railway!"
"What do you mean?" asked Sir Francis.
"I mean to say that the train isn't going on."
The general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly
followed him, and they proceeded together to the conductor.
"Where are we?" asked Sir Francis.
"At the hamlet of Kholby."
"Do we stop here?"
"Certainly. The railway isn't finished."
"What! Not finished?"
"No. There's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here
to Allahabad, where the line begins again."
"But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout."
"What would you have, officer? The papers were mistaken."
"Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta," retorted Sir
Francis, who was growing warm.
"No doubt," replied the conductor; "but the passengers know that
they must provide means of transportation for themselves from
Kholby to Allahabad."
Sir Francis was furious. Passepartout would willingly have
knocked the conductor down, and did not dare to look at his
master.
"Sir Francis," said Mr. Fogg quietly, "we will, if you please,
look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad."
"Mr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage."
"No, Sir Francis; it was foreseen."
"What! You knew that the way -"
"Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner
or later arise on my route. Nothing, therefore, is lost. I have
two days, which I have already gained, to sacrifice. A steamer
leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th. This is the
22nd, and we shall reach Calcutta in time."
There was nothing to say to so confident a response.
It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at
this point. The papers were like some watches, which have a way
of running too fast, and had been premature in their announcement
of the completion of the line. The greater part of the travelers
were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they
began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide -
four-wheeled palkigharis, wagons drawn by zebus, carriages that
looked like perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what
not.
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village
from end to end, came back without having found anything.
"I shall go afoot," said Phileas Fogg.
Passepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry
grimace, as he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian
shoes. Happily he too had been looking about him, and, after a
moment's hesitation, said, "Monsieur, I think I have found a
means of conveyance."
"What?"
"An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but
a hundred steps from here."
"Let's go and see the elephant," replied Mr. Fogg.
They soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some
high palings, was the animal in question. An Indian came out
of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within
the enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had reared,
not for a beast of burden, but for warlike purposes, was half
domesticated. The Indian had begun already, by often irritating
him, and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter, to
impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this method being
often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for
battle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal's instruction
in this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still
preserved his natural gentleness.
Kiouni - this was the name of the beast - could doubtless travel
rapidly for a long time, and, without any other means of
conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are far
from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce; the males,
which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought,
especially as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore
Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused
point-blank.
Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an
hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty
pounds? Refused also. Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout
jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted.
Yet the offer was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the
elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad, his owner would
receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.
Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then
proposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a
thousand pounds for him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was
going to make a great bargain, still refused.
Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to
reflect before he went any further. Mr. Fogg replied that he was
not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand
pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary
to him, and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty
times his value. Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp
eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it was only
a question of how great a price he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered
first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two
thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually so ruddy, was fairly white
with suspense.
At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.
"What a price, good heavens!" cried Passepartout, "for an
elephant!"
It only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively
easy. A young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his
services, which Mr. Fogg accepted, promising so generous a reward
as to materially stimulate his zeal. The elephant was led out and
equipped. The Parsee, who was an accomplished elephant driver,
covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth, and attached to
each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs.
Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes which he
extracted from the famous carpetbag, a proceeding that seemed to
deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals. Then he offered to carry
Sir Francis to Allahabad, which the brigadier gratefully
accepted, as one traveler the more would not be likely to fatigue
the gigantic beast. Provisions were purchased at Kholby, and,
while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side,
Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them. The
Parsee perched himself on the elephant's neck, and at nine
o'clock they set out from the village, the animal marching off
through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut.
Chapter 12
In Which Phileas Fogg and His Companions Venture
across the Indian Forests, and What Follows
In order to shorten the journey, the guide passed to the left of
the line where the railway was still in process of being built.
This line, owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia
Mountains, did not pursue a straight course. The Parsee, who was
quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district, declared
that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through
the forest.
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck in the
peculiar howdahs provided for them, were horribly jostled by the
swift trotting of the elephant, spurred on as he was by the
skillful Parsee. But they endured the discomfort with true
British phlegm, talking little, and scarcely able to catch a
glimpse of each other.
As for Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's back, and
received the direct force of each concussion as he walked along,
he was very careful, in accordance with his master's advice, to
keep his tongue from between his teeth, as it would otherwise
have been bitten off short. The worthy fellow bounced from the
elephant's neck to his rump, and vaulted like a clown on a
spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing, and
from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket, and
inserted it in Kiouni's trunk, who received it without in the
least slackening his regular trot.
After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an
hour for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at
a neighboring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs
round about him. Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the
delay, and both descended with a feeling of relief. "Why, he's
made of iron!" exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on
Kiouni.
"Of forged iron," replied Passepartout, as he set about preparing
a hasty breakfast.
At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure. The country soon
presented a very savage aspect. Copses of dates and dwarf-palms
succeeded the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with
scanty shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite. All this
portion of Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travelers,
is inhabited by a fanatical population, hardened in the most
horrible practices of the Hindoo faith. The English have not been
able to secure complete dominion over this territory, which is
subjected to the influence of rajahs, whom it is almost
impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain retreats. The
travelers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians, who, when
they perceived the elephant striding across-country, made angry
and threatening motions. The Parsee avoided them as much as
possible. Few animals were observed on the route. Even the
monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces
which convulsed Passepartout with laughter.
In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the
worthy servant. What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he
got to Allahabad? Would he carry him on with him? Impossible! The
cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive.
Would he sell him, or set him free? The estimable beast certainly
deserved some consideration. Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him,
Passepartout, a present of Kiouni, he would be very much
embarrassed. These thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long
time.
The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the
evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a
ruined bungalow. They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day,
and an equal distance still separated them from the station of
Allahabad.
The night was cold. The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a
few dry branches, and the warmth was much appreciated. Provisions
purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travelers ate
ravenously. The conversation, beginning with a few disconnected
phrases, soon gave place to loud and steady snores. The guide
watched Kiouni, who slept standing, bolstering himself against
the trunk of a large tree. Nothing occurred during the night to
disturb the slumberers, although occasional growls from panthers
and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence; the more formidable
beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the
occupants of the bungalow. Sir Francis slept heavily, like an
honest soldier overcome with fatigue. Passepartout was wrapped in
uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before. As for Mr. Fogg,
he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene
mansion in Saville Row.
The journey was resumed at six in the morning. The guide hoped to
reach Allahabad by evening. In that case, Mr. Fogg would only
lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of
the tour. Kiouni, resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the
lower spurs of the Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the
village of Kallenger, on the Cani, one of the branches of the
Ganges. The guide avoided inhabited places, thinking it safer to
keep the open country, which lies along the first depressions of
the basin of the great river. Allahabad was now only twelve miles
to the northeast They stopped under a clump of bananas, the fruit
of which, as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream, was
eaten and appreciated.
At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended
several miles. He preferred to travel under cover of the woods.
They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the
journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished,
when the elephant, becoming restless, suddenly stopped.
It was then four o'clock.
"What's the matter?" asked Sir Francis, putting out his head.
"I don't know, officer," replied the Parsee, listening
attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick
branches.
The murmur soon became more distinct. It now seemed like a
distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments.
Passepartout was all eyes and ears. Mr. Fogg patiently waited
without a word. The Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the
elephant to a tree, and plunged into the thicket. He soon
returned, saying: "A procession of Brahmins is coming this way.
We must prevent their seeing us, if possible."
The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at
the same time asking the travelers not to stir. He held himself
ready to bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should flight
become necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of
the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick
foliage, in which they were wholly concealed.
The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer,
and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines
and cymbals. The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the
trees, a hundred paces away; and the strange figures who
performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished
through the branches. First came the priests, with mitres on
their heads, and clothed in long lace robes. They were surrounded
by men, women and children, who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm,
interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals;
while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels, the spokes
of which represented serpents entwined with each other. Upon the
car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a
hideous statue with four arms, the body colored a dull red, with
haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips
tinted with betel. It stood upright upon the figure of a
prostrate and headless giant.
Sir Francis, recognizing the statue, whispered, "The goddess
Kali. The goddess of love and death."
"Of death, perhaps," muttered Passepartout, "but of love - that
ugly old hag? Never!"
The Parsee made a motion to keep silent.
A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round
the statue. They were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts
whence their blood issued drop by drop - stupid fanatics, who, in
the great Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the
wheels of Juggernaut. Some Brahmins, clad in all the
sumptuousness of Oriental apparel, and leading a woman who
faltered at every step, followed. This woman was young, and as
fair as an European. Her head and neck, shoulders, ears, arms,
hands and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems - with
bracelets, earrings and rings; while a tunic bordered with gold,
and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her
form.
The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent
contrast to her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at
their waists, and long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse
on a palanquin. It was the body of an old man, gorgeously
arrayed in the dress of a rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban
embroidered with pearls, a robe of tissue of silk and gold, a
scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds and the magnificent weapons
of a Hindoo prince. Next came the musicians and a rearguard of
capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the
instruments. These closed the procession.
Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and,
turning to the guide, said, "A suttee."
The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips. The procession
slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared
in the depths of the wood. The songs gradually died away.
Occasionally cries were heard in the distance, until at last all
was silence again.
Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the
procession had disappeared, asked: "What is a suttee?"
"A suttee," returned the general, "is a human sacrifice, but a
voluntary one. The woman you have just seen will be burned
tomorrow at the dawn of day."
"Oh, the scoundrels!" cried Passepartout, who could not repress
his indignation.
"And the corpse?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"Is that of the prince, her husband," said the guide. "An
independent rajah of Bundelcund."
"Is it possible," resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice betraying not
the least emotion, "that these barbarous customs still exist in
India, and that the English have been unable to put a stop to
them?"
"These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,"
replied Sir Francis; "but we have no power over these savage
territories, and especially here in Bundelcund. The whole
district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant
murders and pillage."
"The poor wretch!" exclaimed Passepartout. "To be burned alive!"
"Yes," returned Sir Francis, "burned alive. And, if she were not,
you cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit
to from her relatives. They would shave off her hair, feed her on
a scanty allowance of rice, treat her with contempt. She would be
looked upon as an unclean creature, and would die in some corner,
like a scurvy dog. The prospect of so frightful an existence
drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love
or religious fanaticism. Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is
really voluntary, and it requires the active interference of the
Government to prevent it. Several years ago, when I was living at
Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the governor to be
burned along with her husband's body; but, as you may imagine, he
refused. The woman left the town, took refuge with an independent
rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose."
While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several
times, and now said: "The sacrifice which will take place
tomorrow at dawn is not a voluntary one."
"How do you know?"
"Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund."
"But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any
resistance," observed Sir Francis.
"That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and
opium."
"But where are they taking her?"
"To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here. She will pass the
night there."
"And the sacrifice will take place -"
"Tomorrow, at the first light of dawn."
The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket, and leaped
upon his neck. Just at the moment that he was about to urge
Kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle, Mr. Fogg stopped him,
and, turning to Sir Francis Cromarty, said, "Suppose we save this
woman."
"Save the woman, Mr. Fogg!"
"I have yet twelve hours to spare. I can devote them to that."
"Why, you are a man of heart!"
"Sometimes," replied Phileas Fogg, quietly, "when I have the
time."
Chapter 13
In Which Passepartout Receives a New Proof
That Fortune Favors the Brave
The project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps
impracticable. Mr. Fogg was going to risk life, or at least
liberty, and therefore the success of his tour. But he did not
hesitate, and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic
ally.
As for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be
proposed. His master's idea charmed him. He perceived a heart, a
soul, under that icy exterior. He began to love Phileas Fogg.
There remained the guide. What course would he adopt? Would he
not take part with the Indians? In default of his assistance, it
was necessary to be assured of his neutrality. Sir Francis
frankly put the question to him.
"Officer," replied the guide, "I am a Parsee, and this woman is a
Parsee. Command me as you will."
"Excellent!" said Mr. Fogg.
"However," resumed the guide, "it is certain, not only that we
shall risk our lives, but horrible tortures, if we are taken."
"That is foreseen," replied Mr. Fogg. "I think we must wait till
night before acting."
"I think so," said the guide. The worthy Indian then gave some
account of the victim, who, he said, was a celebrated beauty of
the Parsee race, and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant.
She had received a thoroughly English education in that city,
and, from her manners and intelligence, would be thought an
European. Her name was Aouda. Left an orphan, she was married
against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and, knowing the
fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, and devoted by
the rajah's relatives, who had an interest in her death, to the
sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape.
The Parsee's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions
in their generous design. It was decided that the guide should
direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he
accordingly approached as quickly as possible. They halted, half
an hour afterwards, in a copse, some five hundred feet from the
pagoda, where they were well concealed. But they could hear the
groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly.
They then discussed the means of rescuing the victim. The guide
was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he
declared, the young woman was imprisoned. Could they enter any of
its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a
drunken sleep, or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the
walls? This could only be determined at the moment and the place.
But it was certain that the abduction must be made that night,
and not when, at break of day, the victim was led to her funeral
pyre. Then no human intervention could save her.
As soon as night fell, about six o'clock, they decided to make a
reconnaissance around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were
just ceasing. The Indians were in the act of plunging themselves
into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and
it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself.
The Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the
wood, and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a
small stream, whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they
perceived a pyre of wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed
body of the rajah, which was to be burned with his wife. The
pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening
dusk, stood a hundred steps away.
"Come!" whispered the guide.
He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed
by his companions. The silence around was only broken by the low
murmuring of the wind among the branches.
Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was
lit up by the torches. The ground was covered by groups of the
Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep. It seemed a
battlefield strewn with the dead. Men, women and children lay
together.
In the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed
distinctly. Much to the guide's disappointment, the guards of the
rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and
marching to and fro with naked sabres. Probably the priests, too,
were watching within.
The Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an
entrance to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his
companions back again. Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also
saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction. They
stopped, and engaged in a whispered colloquy.
"It is only eight now," said the brigadier, "and these guards may
also go to sleep."
"It is not impossible," returned the Parsee.
They lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited.
The time seemed long. The guide ever and anon left them to take
an observation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched
steadily by the glare of the torches, and a dim light crept
through the windows of the pagoda.
They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the
guards, and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could
not be counted on. The other plan must be carried out. An opening
in the walls of the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain
whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as
assiduously as were the soldiers at the door.
After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready
for the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They took
a roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear. They
reached the walls about half-past twelve, without having met
anyone; here there was no guard, nor were there either windows or
doors.
The night was dark. The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the
horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds. The height of the
trees deepened the darkness.
It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be
accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their
pocket-knives. Happily the temple walls were built of brick and
wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one
brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.
They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and
Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to
make an aperture two feet wide. They were getting on rapidly,
when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple,
followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the
outside. Passepartout and the guide stopped. Had they been
heard? Was the alarm being given? Common prudence urged them to
retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir
Francis. They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till
the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding
themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay. But,
awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the
temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a
surprise.
It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the
party, thus interrupted in their work. They could not now reach
the victim; how, then, could they save her? Sir Francis shook his
fists, Passepartout was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his
teeth with rage. The tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any
emotion.
"We have nothing to do but to go away," whispered Sir Francis.
"Nothing but to go away," echoed the guide.
"Stop," said Fogg. "I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before
noon."
"But what can you hope to do?" asked Sir Francis. "In a few hours
it will be daylight, and -"
"The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last
moment."
Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg's eyes. What
was this cool Englishman thinking of? Was he planning to make a
rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and
boldly snatch her from her executioners? This would be utter
folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such a fool. Sir
Francis consented, however, to remain to the end of this
terrible drama. The guide led them to the rear of the glade,
where they were able to observe the sleeping groups.
Meanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower
branches of a tree, was resolving an idea which had at first
struck him like a flash, and which was now firmly lodged in his
brain.
He had commenced by saying to himself, "What folly!" and then he
repeated, "Why not, after all? It's a chance - perhaps the only
one; and with such sots!" Thinking thus, he slipped, with the
suppleness of a serpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of
which bent almost to the ground.
The hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the
approach of day, though it was not yet light. This was the
moment. The slumbering multitude became animated, the tambourines
sounded, songs and cries arose; the hour of the sacrifice had
come. The doors of the pagoda swung open, and a bright light
escaped from its interior, in the midst of which Mr. Fogg and Sir
Francis saw the victim. She seemed, having shaken off the stupor
of intoxication, to be striving to escape from her executioner.
Sir Francis's heart throbbed; and, convulsively seizing Mr.
Fogg's hand, found in it an open knife. Just at this moment the
crowd began to move. The young woman had again fallen into a
stupor caused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs,
who escorted her with their wild, religious cries.
Phileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of
the crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of
the stream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which
still lay the rajah's corpse. In the semi-obscurity they saw the
victim, quite senseless, stretched out beside her husband's body.
Then a torch was brought, and the wood, heavily soaked with oil,
instantly took fire.
At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg,
who, in an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the
pyre. But he had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene
suddenly changed. A cry of terror arose. The whole multitude
prostrated themselves, terror-stricken, on the ground.
The old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like
a spectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from the
pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened
his ghostly appearance.
Fakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, lay
there, with their faces on the ground, not daring to lift their
eyes and behold such a prodigy.
The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which
supported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden.
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head,
and Passepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied.
The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and,
in an abrupt tone, said, "Let us be off!"
It was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the
midst of the smoke and, profiting by the still over-hanging
darkness, had delivered the young woman from death! It was
Passepartout who, playing his part with a happy audacity, had
passed through the crowd amid the general terror.
A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the
woods, and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace.
But the cries and noise, and a ball which whizzed through
Phileas Fogg's hat, told them that the trick had been
discovered.
The old rajah's body, indeed, now appeared upon the burning pyre;
and the priests, recovered from their terror, perceived that an
abduction had taken place. They hastened into the forest,
followed by the soldiers, who fired a volley after the fugitives;
but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them, and
ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and
arrows.
Chapter 14
In Which Phileas Fogg Descends the Whole Length of the
Beautiful Valley of the Ganges without Ever Thinking of Seeing It
The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour
Passepartout laughed gaily at his success. Sir Francis pressed
the worthy fellow's hand, and his master said, "Well done!"
which, from him, was high commendation; to which Passepartout
replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg.
As for him, he had only been struck with a "queer" idea; and he
laughed to think that for a few moments he, Passepartout, the
ex-gymnast, ex-sergeant fireman, had been the spouse of a
charming woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah! As for the young
Indian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was
passing, and now, wrapped up in a traveling blanket, was
reposing in one of the howdahs.
The elephant, thanks to the skillful guidance of the Parsee, was
advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest, and, an hour
after leaving the pagoda, had crossed a vast plain.
They made a halt at seven o'clock, the young woman being still in
a state of complete prostration. The guide made her drink a
little brandy and water, but the drowsiness which stupefied her
could not yet be shaken off. Sir Francis, who was familiar with
the effects of the intoxication produced by the
fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on her account. But he
was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate. He told
Phileas Fogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would
inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners. These
fanatics were scattered throughout the country, and would,
despite the English police, recover their victim at Madras,
Bombay, or Calcutta. She would only be safe by quitting India
forever.
Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter.
The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock, and, the
interrupted line of railway being resumed, would enable them to
reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours. Phileas Fogg would
thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left
Calcutta the next day, October 25th, at noon, for Hong Kong.
The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the
station, while Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her
various articles of toilet, a dress, shawl and some furs; for
which his master gave him unlimited credit. Passepartout started
off forthwith, and found himself in the streets of Allahabad,
that is, the City of God. One of the most venerated in India, it
was built at the junction of the two sacred rivers, Ganges and
Jumna, the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of
the peninsula. The Ganges, according to the legends of the
Ramayana, rises in heaven, whence, owing to Brahma's agency, it
descends to the earth.
Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to take a
good look at the city. It was formerly defended by a noble fort,
which has since become a state prison. Its commerce has dwindled
away, and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar
as he used to frequent in Regent Street. At last he came upon an
elderly, crusty Jew, who sold second-hand articles, and from whom
he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff, a large mantle and a fine
otter-skin pelisse, for which he did not hesitate to pay
seventy-five pounds. He then returned triumphantly to the
station.
The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda
began gradually to yield, and she became more herself, so that
her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression.
When the poet-king, Ucaf Uddaul, celebrates the charms of the
queen of Ahmehnagara, he speaks thus: "Her shining tresses,
divided in two parts, encircle the harmonious contour of her
white and delicate cheeks, brilliant in their glow and freshness.
Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the
god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest
reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of
Himalaya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes. Her teeth,
fine, equal and white, glitter between her smiling lips like
dewdrops in a passion-flower's half-enveloped breast. Her
delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet,
curved and tender as the lotus-bud, glitter with the brilliancy
of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds of
Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp
around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the
beauty of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the
wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her
tunic she seems to have been modeled in pure silver by the
godlike hand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor."
It is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody to
Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European
acceptance of the phrase. She spoke English with great purity,
and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee
had been transformed by her bringing up.
The train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. Fogg
proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service,
and not a farthing more. This astonished Passepartout, who
remembered all that his master owed to the guide's devotion. He
had, indeed, risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and, if
he should be caught afterwards by the Indians, he would with
difficulty escape their vengeance. Kiouni, also, must be disposed
of. What should be done with the elephant, which had been so
dearly purchased? Phileas Fogg had already determined this
question.
"Parsee," he said to the guide, "you have been serviceable and
devoted. I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion.
Would you like to have this elephant? He is yours."
The guide's eyes glistened.
"Your honor is giving me a fortune!" he cried.
"Take him, guide," returned Mr. Fogg, "and I shall still be your
debtor."
"Good!" exclaimed Passepartout. "Take him, friend. Kiouni is a
brave and faithful beast." And, going up to the elephant, he gave
him several lumps of sugar, saying, "Here, Kiouni, here, here."
The elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping
Passepartout around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high
as his head. Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed the
animal, which replaced him gently on the ground. Soon after,
Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty and Passepartout, installed in
a carriage with Aouda, who had the best seat, were whirling at
full speed towards Benares. It was a run of eighty miles, and was
accomplished in two hours.
During the journey, the young woman fully recovered her senses.
What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage, on
the railway, dressed in European clothes, and with travelers who
were quite strangers to her! Her companions first set about fully
reviving her with a little liquor, and then Sir Francis narrated
to her what had passed, dwelling upon the courage with which
Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her, and
recounting the happy sequel of the venture, the result of
Passepartout's rash idea. Mr. Fogg said nothing; while
Passepartout, abashed, kept repeating that "it wasn't worth
telling."
Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than
words. Her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her
lips. Then, as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the
sacrifice, and recalled the dangers which still menaced her, she
shuddered with terror.
Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda's mind, and
offered, in order to reassure her, to escort her to Hong Kong,
where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up - an
offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted. She had, it
seems, a Parsee relation, who was one of the principal merchants
of Hong Kong, which is wholly an English city, though on an
island on the Chinese coast.
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares. The Brahmin
legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient
Casi, which, like Mahomet's tomb, was once suspended between
heaven and earth. But the Benares of today, which the
Orientalists call the Athens of India, stands quite unpoetically
on solid earth. Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses
and clay huts, giving an aspect of desolation to the place, as
the train entered it.
Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty's destination. The troops he was
rejoining were encamped some miles northward of the city. He bade
adieu to Phileas Fogg, wishing him all success, and expressing
the hope that he would come that way again in a less original but
more profitable fashion. Mr. Fogg lightly pressed him by the
hand. The parting of Aouda, who did not forget what she owed to
Sir Francis, betrayed more warmth. As for Passepartout, he
received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general.
The railway, on leaving Benares, passed for a while along the
valley of the Ganges. Through the windows of their carriage the
travelers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar,
with its mountains clothed in verdure, its fields of barley,
wheat and corn, its jungles peopled with green alligators, its
neat villages and its still thickly-leaved forests. Elephants
were bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups of
Indians, despite the advanced season and chilly air, were
performing solemnly their pious ablutions. These were fervent
Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, their deities being
Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural
forces and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators.
What would these divinities think of India? Anglicized as it is
today, with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges,
frightening the gulls which float upon its surface, the turtles
swarming along its banks and the faithful dwelling upon its
borders?
The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when the
steam concealed it fitfully from the view. The travelers could
scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles southwestward
from Benares, the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or
Ghazipur and its famous rose-waterfactories; or the tomb of Lord
Cornwallis, rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified
town of Buxar, or Patna, a large manufacturing and trading-place,
where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir, a
more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester or
Birmingham, with its iron foundries, edge-tool factories and high
chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward.
Night came on. The train passed on at full speed, in the midst of
the roaring of the tigers, bears and wolves which fled before the
locomotive. The marvels of Bengal, Golconda, ruined Gour,
Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly and the French
town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to
see his country's flag flying, were hidden from their view in the
darkness.
Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left
for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before
him.
According to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of
October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. He
was therefore neither behind nor ahead of time. The two days
gained between London and Bombay had been lost, as has been seen,
in the journey across India. But it is not to be supposed that
Phileas Fogg regretted them.
Chapter 15
In Which the Bag of Banknotes Disgorges
Some Thousands of Pounds More
The train entered the station. Passepartout jumped out first,
followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion to descend.
Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong
steamer, in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the
voyage. He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on
dangerous ground.
Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him,
and said, "Mr. Phileas Fogg?"
"I am he."
"Is this man your servant?" added the policeman, pointing to
Passepartout.
"Yes."
"Be so good, both of you, as to follow me."
Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever. The policeman was a
representative of the law, and law is sacred to an Englishman.
Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman
tapped him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to
obey.
"May this young lady go with us?" he asked. "She may," replied the
policeman.
Mr. Fogg, Aouda and Passepartout were conducted to a palkighari,
a sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses. They took
their places and were driven away. No one spoke during the twenty
minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination.
They first passed through the "black town," with its narrow
streets, its miserable, dirty huts and squalid population; then
through the "European town," which presented a relief in its
bright brick mansions, shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with
masts, where, although it was early morning, elegantly dressed
horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth.
The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which,
however, did not have the appearance of a private mansion. The
policeman having requested his prisoners - for so, truly, they
might be called - to descend, conducted them into a room with
barred windows, and said: "You will appear before Judge Obadiah
at half-past eight."
He then retired, and closed the door.
"Why, we are prisoners!" exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a
chair.
Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg:
"Sir, you must leave me to my fate! It is on my account that you
receive this treatment. It is for having saved me!"
Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was
impossible. It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for
preventing a suttee. The complainants would not dare present
themselves with such a charge. There was some mistake. Moreover,
he would not, in any event, abandon Aouda, but would escort her
to Hong Kong.
"But the steamer leaves at noon!" observed Passepartout,
nervously.
"We shall be on board by noon," replied his master, placidly. It
was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering
to himself, "Parbleu that's certain! Before noon we shall be on
board." But he was by no means reassured.
At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and,
requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall.
It was evidently a courtroom, and a crowd of Europeans and
natives already occupied the rear of the apartment.
Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench
opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk. Immediately
after, Judge Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk,
entered. He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a
nail, and put it hurriedly on his head.
"The first case," he said. Then, putting his hand to his head, he
exclaimed, "Heh! This is not my wig!"
"No, your worship," returned the clerk, "it is mine."
"My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence in
a clerk's wig?"
The wigs were exchanged.
Passepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face of
the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible
rapidity.
"The first case," repeated Judge Obadiah.
"Phileas Fogg?" demanded Oysterpuff.
"I am here," replied Mr. Fogg.
"Passepartout?"
"Present," responded Passepartout.
"Good," said the judge. "You have been looked for, prisoners, for
two days on the trains from Bombay."
"But of what are we accused?" asked Passepartout, impatiently.
"You are about to be informed."
"I am an English subject, sir," said Mr. Fogg, "and I have the
right -"
"Have you been ill-treated?"
"Not at all."
"Very well. Let the complainants come in."
A door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian
priests entered.
"That's it," muttered Passepartout. "These are the rogues who
were going to burn our young lady."
The priests took their places in front of the judge, and the
clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege
against Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having
violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion.
"You hear the charge?" asked the judge.
"Yes, sir," replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, "and I admit
it."
"You admit it?"
"I admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in their
turn, what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji."
The priests looked at each other. They did not seem to understand
what was said.
"Yes," cried Passepartout, warmly; "at the pagoda of Pillaji,
where they were on the point of burning their victim."
The judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were
stupefied.
"What victim?" said Judge Obadiah. "Burn whom? In Bombay itself?"
"Bombay?" cried Passepartout.
"Certainly. we are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of
the pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay."
"And as a proof," added the clerk, "here are the desecrator's
very shoes, which he left behind him."
Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk.
"My shoes!" cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this
imprudent exclamation to escape him.
The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the
affair at Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta,
may be imagined.
Fix, the detective, had foreseen the advantage which
Passepartout's escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for
twelve hours, had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing
that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind
of misdemeanor, he promised them a goodly sum in damages, and
sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the
delay caused by the rescue of the young widow, Fix and the
priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his
servant. The magistrates had been already warned by a despatch to
arrest them should they arrive. Fix's disappointment when he
learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta
may be imagined. He made up his mind that the robber had stopped
somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern
provinces. For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with
feverish anxiety. At last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and
Passepartout arrive, accompanied by a young woman, whose
presence he was wholly at a loss to explain. He hastened for a
policeman, and this was how the party came to be arrested and
brought before Judge Obadiah.
Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have
seen the detective settled in a corner of the courtroom, watching
the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the
warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at
Bombay and Suez.
Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout's rash
exclamation, which the poor fellow would have given the world to
recall.
"The facts are admitted?" asked the judge.
"Admitted," replied Mr. Fogg, coldly.
"Inasmuch," resumed the judge, "as the English law protects
equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as
the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred
pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay, on the 20th of October, I
condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days
and a fine of three hundred pounds."
"Three hundred pounds!" cried Passepartout, startled at the
largeness of the sum.
"Silence!" shouted the constable.
"And inasmuch," continued the judge, "as it is not proved that
the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the
servant, and as the master in any case must be held responsible
for the acts of his paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a
week's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds."
Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction. If Phileas Fogg
could be detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time
for the warrant to arrive. Passepartout was stupefied. This
sentence ruined his master. A wager of twenty thousand pounds
lost, because he, like a precious fool, had gone into that
abominable pagoda!
Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the
least concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was
being pronounced. Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he
rose, and said, "I offer bail."
"You have that right," returned the judge. Fix's blood ran cold,
but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce
that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand
pounds.
"I will pay it at once," said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank
bills from the carpetbag, which Passepartout had by him, and
placing them on the clerk's desk.
"This sum will be restored to you upon your release from
prison," said the judge. "Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail."
"Come!" said Phileas Fogg to his servant.
"But let them at least give me back my shoes!" cried Passepartout
angrily.
"Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!" he muttered, as they were
handed to him. "More than a thousand pounds apiece. Besides,
they pinch my feet."
Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by
the crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that the
robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind
him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued
forth on Mr. Fogg's traces. That gentleman took a carriage, and
the party were soon landed on one of the quays.
The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbor. Its signal
of departure was hoisted at the masthead. Eleven o'clock was
striking. Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time. Fix saw them
leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and
stamped his feet with disappointment.
"The rascal is off, after all!" he exclaimed. "Two thousand
pounds sacrificed! He's as prodigal as a thief! I'll follow him
to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is
going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted."
The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture. Since
leaving London, what with traveling expenses, bribes, the
purchase of the elephant, bails and fines, Mr. Fogg had already
spent more than five thousand pounds on the way, and the
percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber, promised to
the detectives, was rapidly diminishing.
Chapter 16
In Which Fix Does Not Seem to Understand
in the Least What is Said to Him
The Rangoon - one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats
plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas - was a screw steamer,
built of iron, weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons,
and with engines of four hundred horsepower. She was as fast, but
not as well fitted up, as the Mongolia, and Aouda was not as
comfortably provided for on board her as Phileas Fogg could have
wished. However, the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only
comprised some three thousand five hundred miles, occupying from
ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not difficult to
please.
During the first days of the journey Aouda became better
acquainted with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of
her deep gratitude for what he had done. The phlegmatic gentleman
listened to her, apparently at least, with coldness, neither his
voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he
seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting
to Aouda's comfort. He visited her regularly each day at certain
hours, not so much to talk himself, as to sit and hear her talk.
He treated her with the strictest politeness, but with the
precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been
arranged for this purpose. Aouda did not quite know what to make
of him, though Passepartout had given her some hints of his
master's eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the
wager which was sending him round the world. After all, she owed
Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the
exalting medium of her gratitude.
Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching
history. She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native
races of India. Many of the Parsee merchants have made great
fortunes there by dealing in cotton. One of them, Sir Jametsee
Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet by the English government. Aouda
was a relative of this great man, and it was his cousin, Jeejeeh,
whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong. Whether she would find a
protector in him she could not tell; but Mr. Fogg tried to calm
her anxieties, and to assure her that everything would be
mathematically - he used the very word - arranged. Aouda fastened
her great eyes, "clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya," upon
him; but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem
at all inclined to throw himself into this lake.
The first few days of the voyage passed happily, amid favorable
weather and propitious winds, and the ship soon came in sight of
the great Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of
Bengal, with its picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four
hundred feet high, looming above the waters. The steamer passed
along near the shores, but the savage Papuans, who are in the
lowest scale of humanity, but are not, as has been asserted,
cannibals, did not make their appearance.
The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb.
Vast forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic
mimosa and tree-like ferns covered the foreground. Behind, the
graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky;
and along the coasts swarmed thousands of the precious swallows
whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the
Celestial Empire. The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman
Islands was soon passed, however, and the Rangoon rapidly
approached the Straits of Malacca, which give access to the China
seas.
What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to
country, doing all this while? He had managed to embark on the
Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after
leaving orders that, if the warrant should arrive, it should be
forwarded to him at Hong Kong; and he hoped to conceal his
presence to the end of the voyage. It would have been difficult
to explain why he was on board without awakening Passepartout's
suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay. But necessity
impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance with the
worthy servant, as will be seen.
All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centered on Hong
Kong; for the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to
enable him to take any steps there. The arrest must be made at
Hong Kong, or the robber would probably escape him forever. Hong
Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot.
Beyond, China, Japan, America offered to Fogg an almost certain
refuge. If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong
Kong, Fix could arrest him and be no further trouble. But beyond
Hong Kong? a simple warrant would be of no avail. An extradition
warrant would be necessary, and that would result in delays and
obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude
justice.
Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which
he spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, "Now,
either the warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall
arrest my man, or it will not be there. This time it is
absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure. I have
failed at Bombay, and I have failed at Calcutta. If I fail at
Hong Kong, my reputation is lost. Cost what it may, I must
succeed! But how shall I prevent his departure, if that should
turn out to be my last resource?"
Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make
a confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow
his master really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg's
accomplice, he was very certain. The servant, enlightened by his
disclosure, and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime,
would doubtless become an ally of the detective. But this method
was a dangerous one, only to be employed when everything else had
failed. A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all.
The detective was therefore in a sore strait. But suddenly a new
idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon, in company
with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for reflection.
Who was this woman? What combination of events had made her
Fogg's traveling companion? They had evidently met somewhere
between Bombay and Calcutta; but where? Had they met
accidentally, or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in
quest of this charming damsel? Fix was fairly puzzled. He asked
himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement. This idea
so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use
of the supposed intrigue. Whether the young woman were married or
not, he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at
Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money.
But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had an
abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before
anything could be effected, might get full under weigh again for
Yokohama.
Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal
the Rangoon before her arrival. This was easy to do, since the
steamer stopped at Singapore, where there is a telegraphic wire
to Hong Kong. He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more
positively, to question Passepartout. It would not be difficult
to make him talk. As there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to
make himself known.
It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the
Rangoon was due at Singapore.
Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck. Passepartout was
promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer. The
detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme
surprise, and exclaimed, "You here, on the Rangoon?"
"What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?" returned the really
astonished Passepartout, recognizing his crony of the Mongolia.
"Why, I left you at Bombay, and here you are on the way to Hong
Kong! Are you going round the world too?"
"No, no," replied Fix. "I shall stop at Hong Kong - at least for
some days."
"Hum!" said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed.
"But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left
Calcutta?"
"Oh, a trifle of seasickness - I've been staying in my berth. The
Gulf of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian
Ocean. And how is Mr. Fogg?"
"As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time! But,
Monsieur Fix, you don't know that we have a young lady with us."
"A young lady?" replied the detective, not seeming to comprehend
what was said.
Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda's history, the affair at
the Bombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand
pounds, the rescue, the arrest and sentence of the Calcutta
court, and the restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on
bail. Fix, who was familiar with the last events, seemed to be
equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related; and the latter
was charmed to find so interested a listener.
"But does your master propose to carry this young woman to
Europe?"
"Not at all. We are simply going to place her under the
protection of one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong
Kong."
"Nothing to be done there," said Fix to himself, concealing his
disappointment. "A glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?"
"Willingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly glass
on board the Rangoon."
Chapter 17
Showing What Happened on the Voyage from Singapore to Hong Kong
The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this
interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce
his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. He
caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice. But
Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin, where he kept
Aouda company, or, according to his inveterate habit, took a hand
at whist.
Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange
chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing.
It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable
and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then
encountered on board the Mongolia, who disembarked at Bombay,
which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so
unexpectedly on the Rangoon, was following Mr. Fogg's tracks
step by step. What was Fix's object? Passepartout was ready to
wager his Indian shoes - which he religiously preserved - that
Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them, and
probably on the same steamer.
Passepartout might have cudgeled his brain for a century without
hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He
never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as
a robber around the globe. But, as it is in human nature to
attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly
discovered an explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth
far from unreasonable. Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of
Mr. Fogg's friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and
to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been
agreed upon.
"It's clear!" repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of
his shrewdness. "He's a spy sent to keep us in view! That isn't
quite the thing, either, to be spying on Mr. Fogg, who is so
honorable a man! Ah, gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you
dear!"
Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say
nothing to his master, lest he should be justly offended at this
mistrust on the part of his adversaries. But he determined to
chaff Fix, when he had the chance, with mysterious allusions,
which, however, need not betray his real suspicions.
During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon
entered the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of
that name from Sumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets
intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of
the travelers. The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next
day at four A.M., to receive coal, having gained half a day on
the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas Fogg noted this gain
in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who betrayed a
desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.
Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them
cautiously, without being himself perceived; while Passepartout,
laughing in his sleeve at Fix's maneuvers, went about his usual
errands.
The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are
no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. It
is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome
carriage, drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried
Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with
brilliant foliage, and of clover-trees, whereof the cloves form
the head of a half-open flower. Pepper plants replaced the
prickly hedges of European fields. Sago-bushes, large ferns with
gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of this tropical clime.
Nutmeg trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating
perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the
trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.
After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr.
Fogg returned to the town, which is a vast collection of
heavy-looking, irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens
rich in tropical fruits and plants. At ten o'clock they
re-embarked, closely followed by the detective, who had kept them
constantly in sight.
Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes - a
fruit as large as good-sized apples, of a dark brown color
outside and a bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in
the mouth, affords gourmands a delicious sensation - was waiting
for them on deck. He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to
Aouda, who thanked him very gracefully for them.
At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbor, and
in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests,
inhabited by the most beautifully furred tigers in the world,
were lost to view. Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred
miles from the island of Hong Kong, which is a little English
colony near the Chinese coast. Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish
the journey in six days, so as to be in time for the steamer
which would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama, the
principal Japanese port.
The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom
disembarked at Singapore, among them a number of Indians,
Ceylonese, Chinamen, Malays and Portuguese, mostly second-class
travelers.
The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last
quarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at
intervals rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the
southwest, and thus aided the steamer's progress. The captain as
often as possible put up his sails, and under the double action
of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coast
of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to the defective construction of
the Rangoon, however, unusual precautions became necessary in
unfavorable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from
this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses,
did not seem to affect his master in the least. Passepartout
blamed the captain, the engineer and the crew, and
consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where
the pepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was
remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row, had
something to do with his hot impatience.
"You are in a great hurry, then," said Fix to him one day, "to
reach Hong Kong?"
"A very great hurry!"
"Mr. Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer for
Yokohama?"
"Terribly anxious."
"You believe in this journey around the world, then?"
"Absolutely. Don't you, Mr. Fix?"
"I? I don't believe a word of it."
"You're a sly dog!" said Passepartout, winking at him.
This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why.
Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose? He knew not what to
think. But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a
detective? Yet, in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant
more than he expressed.
Passepartout went still further the next day. He could not hold
his tongue.
"Mr. Fix," said he, in a bantering tone, "shall we be so
unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?"
"Why," responded Fix, a little embarrassed, "I don't know;
perhaps -"
"Ah, if you would only go on with us! An agent of the Peninsular
Company, you know, can't stop on the way! You were only going to
Bombay, and here you are in China. America is not far off, and
from America to Europe is only a step."
Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as
serene as possible, and laughed with him. But Passepartout
persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his
present occupation.
"Yes, and no," returned Fix. "There is good and bad luck in such
things. But you must understand that I don't travel at my own
expense."
"Oh, I am quite sure of that!" cried Passepartout, laughing
heartily.
Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up
to his reflections. He was evidently suspected; somehow or other
the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective. But had he
told his master? What part was he playing in all this. Was he an
accomplice or not? Was the game, then, up? Fix spent several
hours turning these things over in his mind, sometimes thinking
that all was lost, then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant
of his presence, and then undecided what course it was best to
take.
Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last
resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout. If he did not find it
practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made
preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory,
he, Fix, would tell Passepartout all. Either the servant was the
accomplice of his master, and in this case the master knew of his
operations, and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing
about the robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the
robber.
Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout. Meanwhile
Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and
unconscious indifference. He was passing methodically in his
orbit around the world, regardless of the lesser stars which
gravitated around him. Yet there was near by what the astronomers
would call a disturbing star, which might have produced an
agitation in this gentleman's heart. But no! The charms of Aouda
failed to act, to Passepartout's great surprise; and the
disturbances, if they existed, would have been more difficult to
calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of
Neptune.
It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read
in Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master.
Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought,
quite heartless. As to the sentiment which this journey might
have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing;
while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries.
One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine room, and was
observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw
the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the
valves; and this made Passepartout indignant.
"The valves are not sufficiently charged!" he exclaimed. "We are
not going. Oh, these English! If this was an American craft, we
should blow up, perhaps, but we should at all events go faster!"
Chapter 18
In Which Phileas Fogg, Passepartout and Fix
Go Each about His Business
The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage. The
wind, obstinately remaining in the northwest, blew a gale, and
retarded the steamer. The Rangoon rolled heavily and the
passengers became impatient of the long, monstrous waves which
the wind raised before their path. A sort of tempest arose on the
3rd of November, the squall knocking the vessel about with fury,
and the waves running high. The Rangoon reefed all her sails, and
even the rigging proved too much, whistling and shaking amid the
squall. The steamer was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain
estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind
time, and more if the storm lasted.
Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to be
struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual
tranquillity. He never changed countenance for an instant, though
a delay of twenty hours, by making him too late for the Yokohama
boat, would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager. But
this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance. It
seemed as if the storm were a part of his program, and had been
foreseen. Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been
from the first time she saw him.
Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light. The
storm greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been
complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the
violence of wind and waves. Each delay filled him with hope, for
it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to
remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves
became his allies, with the gusts and squalls. It mattered not
that they made him seasick - he made nothing of this
inconvenience; and, while his body was writhing under their
effects, his spirit bounded with hopeful joy.
Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious
weather. Everything had gone so well till now! Earth and sea had
seemed to be at his master's service. Steamers and railways
obeyed him. Wind and steam united to speed his journey. Had the
hour of adversity come? Passepartout was as much excited as if
the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket. The
storm exasperated him, the gale made him furious, and he longed
to lash the obstinate sea into obedience. Poor fellow! Fix
carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction, for, had he
betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself
from personal violence.
Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted,
being unable to remain quiet below, and taking it into his head
to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew.
He overwhelmed the captain, officers and sailors, who could not
help laughing at his impatience, with all sorts of questions. He
wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last. He
was referred to the barometer, which seemed to have no intention
of rising. Passepartout shook it, but with no perceptible effect;
for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon if to
change its mind.
On the 4th, however, the sea became more calm, and the storm
lessened its violence. The wind veered southward, and was once
more favorable. Passepartout cleared up with the weather. Some of
the sails were unfurled, and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid
speed. The time lost could not, however, be regained. Land was
not signaled until five o'clock on the morning of the 6th. The
steamer was due on the 5th. Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours
behind, and the Yokohama steamer would, of course, be missed.
The pilot went on board at six, and took his place on the bridge,
to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong
Kong. Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for
Yokohama; but he dared not, for he wished to preserve the spark
of hope, which still remained till the last moment. He had
confided his anxiety to Fix who - the sly rascal - tried to
console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took
the next boat. This only put Passepartout in a passion.
Mr. Fogg, bolder than his servant, did not hesitate to approach
the pilot, and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would
leave Hong Kong for Yokohama.
"At high tide tomorrow morning," answered the pilot.
"Ah!" said Mr. Fogg, without betraying any astonishment.
Passepartout, who heard what passed, would willingly have
embraced the pilot, while Fix would have been glad to twist his
neck.
"What is the steamer's name?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"The Carnatic."
"Ought she not to have gone yesterday?"
"Yes, sir; but they had to repair one of her boilers, and so her
departure was postponed till tomorrow."
"Thank you," returned Mr. Fogg, descending mathematically to the
saloon.
Passepartout clasped the pilot's hand and shook it heartily in
his delight, exclaiming, "Pilot, you are the best of good
fellows!"
The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses
won him this enthusiastic greeting. He remounted the bridge, and
guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks, tankas and
fishing boats which crowded the harbor of Hong Kong.
At one o'clock the Rangoon was at the quay, and the passengers
were going ashore.
Chance had strangely favored Phileas Fogg, for if the Carnatic
had not been forced to lie over for repairing her boiler, she
would have left on the 6th of November, and the passengers for
Japan would have been obliged to wait a week for the sailing of
the next steamer. Mr. Fogg was, it is true, twenty-four hours
behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the
remainder of his tour.
The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San
Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and
it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama. If Mr. Fogg
was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time would
no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days
across the Pacific. He found himself, then, about twenty-four
hours behind time, thirty-five days after leaving London.
The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next
morning. Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his
business there, which was to deposit Aouda safely with her
wealthy relative.
On landing, he conducted her to a palanquin, in which they
repaired to the Club Hotel. A room was engaged for the young
woman, and Mr. Fogg, after seeing that she wanted for nothing,
set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh. He instructed
Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return, that Aouda
might not be left entirely alone.
Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange, where, he did not doubt,
everyone would know so wealthy and considerable a person as the
Parsee merchant. Meeting a broker, he made the inquiry, to learn
that Jeejeeh had left China two years before, and, retiring from
business with an immense fortune, had taken up his residence in
Europe -in- Holland the broker thought, with the merchants of
which country he had principally traded. Phileas Fogg returned to
the hotel, begged a moment's conversation with Aouda, and,
without more ado, told her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong
Kong, but probably in Holland.
Aouda at first said nothing. She passed her hand across her
forehead, and reflected a few moments. Then, in her sweet, soft
voice, she said: "What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?"
"It is very simple," responded the gentleman. "Co on to Europe."
"But I cannot intrude -"
"You do not intrude, nor do you in the least embarrass my
project. Passepartout!"
"Monsieur."
"Go to the Carnatic, and engage three cabins."
Passepartout, delighted that the young woman, who was very
gracious to him, was going to continue the journey with them,
went off at a brisk gait to obey his master's order.
Chapter 19
In Which Passepartout Takes a Too Great Interest in His Master,
and What Comes of It
Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the
English by the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the
colonizing genius of the English has created upon it an important
city and an excellent port. The island is situated at the mouth
of the Canton River, and is separated by about sixty miles from
the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite coast. Hong Kong
has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade, and now
the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its
depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic
cathedral, a government house, macadamized streets, give to Hong
Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by
some strange magic to the antipodes.
Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the
Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and
other modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese
and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong
seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta and Singapore, since,
like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English
supremacy. At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships
of all nations: English, French, American and Dutch, men-of-war
and trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas
and flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres.
Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who
seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going into a
barber's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all
at least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to
wear yellow, which is the Imperial color. Passepartout, without
exactly knowing why, thought this very funny.
On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic,
he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The
detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed.
"This is bad," muttered Passepartout, "for the gentlemen of the
Reform Club!" He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had
not perceived that gentleman's chagrin. The detective had,
indeed, good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which
pursued him. The warrant had not come! It was certainly on the
way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for
several days. This being the last English territory on Mr. Fogg's
route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage to detain
him.
"Well, Monsieur Fix," said Passepartout, "have you decided to go
with us as far as America?"
"Yes," returned Fix, through his set teeth.
"Good!" exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily. "I knew you
could not persuade yourself to separate from us. Come and engage
your berth."
They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four
persons. The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them
that, the repairs on the Carnatic having been completed, the
steamer would leave that very evening, and not next morning, as
had been announced.
"That will suit my master all the better," said Passepartout. "I
will go and let him know."
Fix now decided to make a bold move. He resolved to tell
Passepartout all. It seemed to be the only possible means of
keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong. He
accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his
eye on the quay. On entering, they found themselves in a large
room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large
campbed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon this
bed in a deep sleep. At the small tables which were arranged
about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer,
porter, gin and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes
stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose.
From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the
narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters,
taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the
bed. The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots.
Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking house
haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom
the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called
opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds
- thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which
afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to
deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from
the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the
lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium
is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the
Celestial Empire. Once accustomed to it, the victims cannot
dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions
and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a
day, but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that
Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found
themselves. Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted
Fix's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some
future time.
They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did
ample justice, while Fix observed him with close attention. They
chatted about the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry
at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them. When the
bottles were empty, however, he rose to go and tell his master of
the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic.
Fix caught him by the arm, and said, "Wait a moment."
"What for, Mr. Fix?"
"I want to have a serious talk with you."
"A serious talk!" cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine
that was left in the bottom of his glass. "Well, we'll talk about
it tomorrow. I haven't time now."
"Stay! What I have to say concerns your master."
Passepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. Fix's
face seemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his seat.
"What is it that you have to say?"
Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout's arm, and, lowering his
voice, said, "You have guessed who I am?"
"Parbleu!" said Passepartout, smiling.
"Then I'm going to tell you everything -"
"Now that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that's very good. But
go on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen
have put themselves to a useless expense."
"Useless!" said Fix. "You speak confidently. It's clear that you
don't know how large the sum is."
"Of course I do," returned Passepartout. "Twenty thousand
pounds."
"Fifty-five thousand!" answered Fix, pressing his companion's
hand.
"What!" cried the Frenchman. "Has Monsieur Fogg dared -
fifty-five thousand pounds! Well, there's all the more reason for
not losing an instant," he continued, getting up hastily.
Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed:
"Fifty-five thousand pounds, and if I succeed, I get two thousand
pounds. If you'll help me, I'll let you have five hundred of
them."
"Help you?" cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide
open.
"Yes, help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days."
"Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with
following my master and suspecting his honor, but they must try
to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as
well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!"
"That's just what we count on doing."
"It's a conspiracy, then," cried Passepartout, who became more
and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank
without perceiving it. "A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too.
Bah!"
Fix began to be puzzled.
"Members of the Reform Club!" continued Passepartout. "You must
know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that,
when he makes a wager, he tries to win it fairly!"
"But who do you think I am?" asked Fix, looking at him intently.
"Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out
here to interrupt my master's journey. But, though I found you
out some time ago, I've taken good care to say nothing about it
to Mr. Fogg."
"He knows nothing, then?"
"Nothing," replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass. The
detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before
he spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout's mistake seemed
sincere, but it made his design more difficult. It was evident
that the servant was not the master's accomplice, as Fix had been
inclined to suspect.
"Well," said the detective to himself, "as he is not an
accomplice, he will help me."
He had no time to lose. Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he
resolved to make a clean breast of it.
"Listen to me," said Fix abruptly. "I am not, as you think, an
agent of the members of the Reform Club -"
"Bah!" retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.
"I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office."
"You, a detective?"
"I will prove it. Here is my commission."
Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed
this document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.
"Mr. Fogg's wager," resumed Fix, "is only a pretext, of which you
and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for
securing your innocent complicity."
"But why?"
"Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five
thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person
whose description was fortunately secured. Here is this
description. It answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg."
"What nonsense!" cried Passepartout, striking the table with his
fist. "My master is the most honorable of men!"
"How can you tell? You know scarcely anything about him. You went
into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a
foolish pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in
banknotes. And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an
honest man!"
"Yes, yes," repeated the poor fellow, mechanically.
"Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?"
Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head
between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective.
Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man,
a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him!
Passepartout tried to reject the suspicions which forced
themselves upon his mind. He did not wish to believe that his
master was guilty.
"Well, what do you want of me?" he said, at last, with an effort.
"See here," replied Fix, "I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place,
but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for
which I sent to London. You must help me to keep him here in Hong
Kong -"
"I! But I -"
"I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by
the Bank of England."
"Never!" replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back,
exhausted in mind and body.
"Mr. Fix," he stammered, "even should what you say be true - if
my master is really the robber you are seeking for - which I deny
- I have been, am, in his service. I have seen his generosity and
goodness; and I will never betray him -not for all the gold in
the world. I come from a village where they don't eat that kind
of bread!"
"You refuse?"
"I refuse."
"Consider that I've said nothing," said Fix, "and let us drink."
"Yes, let us drink!"
Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects
of the liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be
separated from his master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some
pipes full of opium lay upon the table. Fix slipped one into
Passepartout's hand. He took it, put it between his lips, lit it,
drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the
influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.
"At last!" said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. "Mr. Fogg
will not be informed of the Carnatic's departure, and, if he is,
he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!"
And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern.
Chapter 20
In Which Fix Comes Face to Face with Phileas Fogg
While these events were passing at the opium house, Mr. Fogg,
unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was
quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter,
making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them.
It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the
tour of the world with a carpetbag; a lady could not be expected
to travel comfortably under such conditions. He acquitted his
task with characteristic serenity, and invariably replied to the
objections of his fair companion, who was confused by his
patience and generosity. "It is in the interest of my journey - a
part of my program."
The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined
at a sumptuously served table-d'hote; after which Aouda, shaking
hands with her protector after the English fashion, retired to
her room for rest. Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the
evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News.
Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would
have been not to see his servant return at bedtime. But, knowing
that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next
morning, he did not disturb himself about the matter. When
Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his
master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying the least vexation,
contented himself with taking his carpetbag, calling Aouda, and
sending for a palanquin.
It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high
tide, the Carnatic would leave the harbor. Mr. Fogg and Aouda got
into the palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a
wheelbarrow, and half an hour later stepped upon the quay where
they were to embark. Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had
sailed the evening before. He had expected to find not only the
steamer, but his servant, and was forced to give up both; but no
sign of disappointment appeared on his face, and he merely
remarked to Aouda, "It is an accident, madam, nothing more."
At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively
approached. It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg: "Were
you not, like me, sir, a passenger on the Rangoon, which arrived
yesterday?"
"I was, sir," replied Mr. Fogg coldly. "But I have not the honor
-"
"Pardon me. I thought I should find your servant here."
"Do you know where he is, sir?" asked Aouda anxiously.
"What!" responded Fix, feigning surprise. "Is he not with you?"
"No," said Aouda. "He has not made his appearance since
yesterday. Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?"
"Without you, madam?" answered the detective. "Excuse me, did you
intend to sail in the Carnatic?"
"Yes, sir."
"So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The
Carnatic, its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve
hours before the stated time, without any notice being given. We
must now wait a week for another steamer."
As he said "a week" Fix felt his heart leap for joy. Fogg
detained at Hong Kong for a week! There would be time for the
warrant to arrive, and fortune at last favored the representative
of the law. His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg
say, in his placid voice, "But there are other vessels besides
the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the harbor of Hong Kong."
And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps towards the
docks in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied,
followed. It seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an
invisible thread. Chance, however, appeared really to have
abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well. For three
hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks, with the
determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to carry him to
Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or
unloading, and which could not therefore set sail. Fix began to
hope again.
But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his
search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when
he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves.
"Is your honor looking for a boat?"
"Have you a boat ready to sail?"
"Yes, your honor; a pilot boat - No. 43 - the best in the
harbor."
"Does she go fast?"
"Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look at her?"
"Yes."
"Your honor will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea
excursion?"
"No, for a voyage."
"A voyage?"
"Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?"
The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said,
"Is your honor joking?"
"No. I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by
the 14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco.
"I am sorry," said the sailor, "but it is impossible."
"I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward
of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time."
"Are you in earnest?"
"Very much so."
The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea,
evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and
the fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense.
Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, "You would not be afraid,
would you, madam?"
"Not with you, Mr. Fogg," was her answer. The pilot now returned,
shuffling his hat in his hands.
"Well, pilot?" said Mr. Fogg.
"Well, your honor," replied he, "I could not risk myself, my men,
or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at
this time of year. Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time,
for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong."
"Only sixteen hundred," said Mr. Fogg.
"It's the same thing."
Fix breathed more freely.
"But," added the pilot, "it might be arranged another way." Fix
ceased to breathe at all.
"How?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to
Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going
to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese
coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run
northward, and would aid us."
"Pilot," said Mr. Fogg, "I must take the American steamer at
Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki."
"Why not?" returned the pilot. "The San Francisco steamer does
not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but
it starts from Shanghai."
"You are sure of that?"
"Perfectly."
"And when does the boat leave Shanghai?"
"On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four
days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we
had good luck and a southwest wind, and the sea was calm, we
could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai."
"And you could go -"
"In an hour. As soon as provisions could be got aboard and the
sails put up."
"It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?"
"Yes, John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere."
"Would you like some money?"
"If it would not put your honor out -"
"Here are two hundred pounds on account, sir," added Phileas
Fogg, turning to Fix, "if you would like to take advantage -"
"Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favor."
"Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board."
"But poor Passepartout?" urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by
the servant's disappearance.
"I shall do all I can to find him," replied Phileas Fogg.
While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot
boat, the others directed their course to the police-station at
Hong Kong. Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description,
and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The
same formalities having been gone through at the French
consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the
luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the
wharf.
It was now three o'clock; and pilot boat No.43, with its crew on
board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.
The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as
gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining
copper sheathing, her galvanized iron-work, her deck, white as
ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her
presentable. Her two masts leaned a trifle backward. She carried
brigantine, foresail, storm-jib and standing-jib, and was well
rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of
brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining
several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the Tankadere was
composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who
were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man
of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a
sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant
countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.
Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix
already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the
walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in
the center was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The
accommodation was confined, but neat.
"I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you," said Mr. Fogg
to Fix, who bowed without responding.
The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by
the kindness of Mr. Fogg.
"It's certain," thought he, "though rascal he is, he is a polite
one!"
The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past
three. Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last
glance at the quay, in the hope of seeing Passepartout. Fix was
not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the
unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this
direction. In that case an explanation the reverse of
satisfactory to the detective would have been necessary. But the
Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying
under the stupefying influence of the opium. At length John
Bunsby, master, gave the order to start, and the Tankadere,
taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail and standing-jib,
bounded briskly forward over the waves.
Chapter 21
In Which the Master of the Tankadere Runs Great Risk
of Losing a Reward of Two Hundred Pounds
This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a
craft of twenty tons, and at that season of the year. The Chinese
seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind,
especially during the equinoxes, and it was now early November.
It would clearly have been to the master's advantage to carry his
passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day.
But he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was
imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby
believed in the Tankadere, which rode on the waves like a
seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong.
Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of
Hong Kong, and the Tankadere, impelled by favorable winds,
conducted herself admirably.
"I do not need, pilot," said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the
open sea, "to advise you to use all possible speed."
"Trust me, your honor. We are carrying all the sail the wind will
let us. The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we
are going into port."
"It's your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you."
Phileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like
a sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters. The
young woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she
looked out upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on
which she had ventured in so frail a vessel. Above her head
rustled the white sails, which seemed like great white wings. The
boat, carried forward by the wind, seemed to be flying in the
air.
Night came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her
insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon.
Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of
the heavens.
The pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in
these seas crowded with vessels bound landward. Collisions are
not uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the
least shock would shatter the gallant little craft.
Fix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation. He kept
apart from his fellow-travelers, knowing Mr. Fogg's taciturn
tastes. Besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose
favors he had accepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. It
seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at
once take the boat for San Francisco; and the vast extent of
America would ensure him impunity and safety. Fogg's plan
appeared to him the simplest in the world.
Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States,
like a common villain, he had traveled three quarters of the
globe, so as to gain the American continent more surely. There,
after throwing the police off his track, he would quietly enjoy
himself with the fortune stolen from the bank. But, once in the
United States, what should he, Fix, do? Should he abandon this
man? No, a hundred times no! Until he had secured his
extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an hour. It was
his duty, and he would fulfill it to the end. At all events,
there was one thing to be thankful for. Passepartout was not with
his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences
Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have
speech with his master.
Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so
strangely disappeared. Looking at the matter from every point of
view, it did not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake,
the man might have embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment.
This was also Aouda's opinion, who regretted very much the loss
of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much. They might then
find him at Yokohama, for, if the Carnatic was carrying him
thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board.
A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock; but, though it might have
been prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully
examining the heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before. The
Tankadere bore sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water,
and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale.
Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having
been already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the
cots. The pilot and crew remained on deck all night.
At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had
made more than one hundred miles. The log indicated a mean speed
of between eight and nine miles. The Tankadere still carried all
sail, and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed. If
the wind held as it was, the chances would be in her favor.
During the day she kept along the coast, where the currents were
favorable. The coast, regular in profile, and visible sometimes
across the clearings, was at most five miles distant. The sea was
less violent, since the wind came off land - a fortunate
circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing to its small
tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.
The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the
southwest. The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again
within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew.
Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the
sea, ate with a good appetite. Fix was invited to share their
repast, and he accepted with secret chagrin. To travel at this
man's expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to
him. Still, he was obliged to eat, and so he ate.
When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, "sir" -
this "sir" scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to
avoid collaring this "gentleman" - "sir, you have been very kind
to give me a passage on this boat. But, though my means will not
admit of my expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my
share -"
"Let us not speak of that, sir," replied Mr. Fogg.
"But, if I insist -"
"No, sir," repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a
reply. "This enters into my general expenses."
Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward,
where he ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest
of the day.
Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in
high hope. He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would
reach Shanghai in time; to which that gentleman responded that he
counted upon it. The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired
by the reward to be gained. There was not a sheet which was not
tightened, not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted; not a
lurch could be charged to the man at the helm. They worked as
desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta.
By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had
been accomplished from Hong Kong. Mr. Fogg might hope that he
would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in
his journal; in which case, the many misadventures which had
overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect
his journey.
The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the
island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of
the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very
rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the
counter-currents, and the chopping waves broke her course, while
it became very difficult to stand on deck.
At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens
seemed to predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy
change, the mercury rising and falling capriciously. The sea
also, in the southeast, raised long surges which indicated a
tempest. The sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the
midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.
John Bunsby examined the threatening aspect of the heavens,
muttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last he said in a
low voice to Mr. Fogg, "Shall I speak out to your honor?"
"Of course."
"Well, we are going to have a squall."
"Is the wind north or south?" asked Mr. Fogg quietly.
"South. Look! A typhoon is coming up."
"Glad it's a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us
forward."
"Oh, if you take it that way," said John Bunsby, "I've nothing
more to say." John Bunsby's suspicions were confirmed. At a less
advanced season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous
meteorologist, would have passed away like a luminous cascade of
electric flame; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared
that it would burst upon them with great violence.
The pilot took his precautions in advance. He reefed all sail,
the pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the
bows. A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as
a storm-jib, so as to hold the wind from behind. Then they
waited.
John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this
imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat
bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant. Neither Mr. Fogg,
Fix, nor Aouda consented to leave the deck. The storm of rain and
wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock. With but its bit
of sail, the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind, an
idea of whose violence can scarcely be given. To compare her
speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam
would be below the truth.
The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by
monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to
theirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these
mountains of water which rose behind her, but the adroit
management of the pilot saved her. The passengers were often
bathed in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically. Fix
cursed it, but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector,
whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and
bravely weathered the storm. As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just
as if the typhoon were a part of his program.
Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the
north; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore
down from the northwest. The boat, now lying in the trough of the
waves, shook and rolled terribly. The sea struck her with fearful
violence. At night the tempest increased in violence. John Bunsby
saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with
dark misgivings. He thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it
was not time to slacken speed. After a consultation he approached
Mr. Fogg, and said, "I think, your honor, that we should do well
to make for one of the ports on the coast."
"I think so too."
"Ah!" said the pilot. "But which one?"
"I know of but one," returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.
"And that is -"
"Shanghai."
The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend. He could
scarcely realize so much determination and tenacity. Then he
cried, "Well - yes! Your honor is right. To Shanghai!"
So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track.
The night was really terrible. It would be a miracle if the craft
did not founder. Twice it would have been all over with her if
the crew had not been constantly on the watch. Aouda was
exhausted, but did not utter a complaint. More than once Mr. Fogg
rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves.
Day reappeared. The tempest still raged with undiminished fury,
but the wind now returned to the southeast. It was a favorable
change, and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this
mountainous sea, though the waves crossed each other, and
imparted shocks and countershocks which would have crushed a
craft less solidly built. From time to time the coast was visible
through the broken mist, but no vessel was in sight. The
Tankadere was alone upon the sea.
There were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more
distinct as the sun descended towards the horizon. The tempest
had been as brief as terrific. The passengers, thoroughly
exhausted, could now eat a little, and take some repose.
The night was comparatively quiet. Some of the sails were again
hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good. The next
morning at dawn they saw the coast, and John Bunsby was able to
assert that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai. A
hundred miles, and only one day to cross them! That very evening
Mr. Fogg was due at Shanghai, if he did not wish to miss the
steamer to Yokohama. Had there been no storm, during which
several hours were lost, they would be at this moment within
thirty miles of their destination.
The wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with it.
All sails were now hoisted, and at noon the Tankadere was within
forty-five miles of Shanghai. There remained yet six hours in
which to accomplish that distance. All on board feared that it
could not be done, and every one - Phileas Fogg, no doubt,
excepted - felt his heart beat with impatience. The boat must
keep up an average of nine miles an hour, and the wind was
becoming calmer every moment! It was a capricious breeze, coming
from the coast, and after it passed the sea became smooth. Still,
the Tankadere was so light, and her fine sails caught the fickle
zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the current, John Bunsby
found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the
mouth of Shanghai River. Shanghai itself is situated at least
twelve miles up the stream. At seven they were still three miles
from Shanghai. The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two
hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him. He
looked at Mr. Fogg. Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil, yet his
whole fortune was at this moment at stake.
At this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths
of smoke, appeared on the edge of the waters. It was the American
steamer, leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time.
"Confound her!" cried John Bunsby, pushing back the rudder with a
desperate jerk.
"Signal her!" said Phileas Fogg quietly.
A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere
for making signals in the fogs. It was loaded to the muzzle, but
just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the
touchhole, Mr. Fogg said, "Hoist your flag!"
The flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal of
distress, it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving it,
would change her course a little, so as to help the pilot boat.
"Fire!" said Mr. Fogg. And the booming of the little cannon
resounded in the air.
Chapter 22
In Which Passepartout Finds Out That, Even at the Antipodes,
It Is Convenient to Have Some Money in One's Pocket
The Carnatic, setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the
7th of November, directed her course at full steam towards Japan.
She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers.
Two state-rooms in the rear were, however, unoccupied - those
which had been engaged by Phileas Fogg.
The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye, staggering
gait and disordered hair, was seen to emerge from the second
cabin, and to totter to a seat on deck.
It was Passepartout. What had happened to him was as follows.
Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the
unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved
for the smokers. Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by
a fixed idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the
stupefying influence of the narcotic. The thought of a duty
unfulfilled shook off his torpor, and he hurried from the abode
of drunkenness. Staggering and holding himself up by keeping
against the walls, falling down and creeping up again, and
irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he kept crying out,
"The Carnatic! the Carnatic!"
The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of
starting. Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon
the plank, he crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just
as the Carnatic was moving off. Several sailors, who were
evidently accustomed to this sort of scene, carried the poor
Frenchman down into the second cabin, and Passepartout did not
wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from China.
Thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the
Carnatic, and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea breeze. The
pure air sobered him. He began to collect his sense, which he
found a difficult task, but at last he recalled the events of the
evening before, Fix's revelation, and the opium house.
"It is evident," he said to himself, "that I have been
abominably drunk! What will Mr. Fogg say? At least I have not
missed the steamer, which is the most important thing."
Then, as Fix occurred to him: "As for that rascal, I hope we are
well rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, to
follow us on board the Carnatic. A detective on the track of Mr.
Fogg, accused of robbing the Bank of England! Pshaw! Mr. Fogg is
no more a robber than I am a murderer. "Should he divulge Fix's
real errand to his master? Would it do to tell the part the
detective was playing? Would it not be better to wait until Mr.
Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an agent
of the metropolitan police had been following him round the
world, and have a good laugh over it? No doubt, at least, it was
worth considering. The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg,
and apologize for his singular behavior.
Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the
rolling of the steamer, to the afterdeck. He saw no one who
resembled either his master or Aouda. "Good!" muttered he; "Aouda
has not gotten up yet, and Mr. Fogg has probably found some
partners at whist."
He descended to the saloon. Mr. Fogg was not there. Passepartout
had only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master's
stateroom. The purser replied that he did not know any passenger
by the name of Fogg.
"I beg your pardon," said Passepartout persistently. "He is a
tall gentleman, quiet and not very talkative, and has with him a
young lady -"
"There is no young lady on board," interrupted the purser. "Here
is a list of the passengers. You may see for yourself."
Passepartout scanned the list, but his master's name was not upon
it. All at once an idea struck him.
"Ah! Am I on the Carnatic?"
"Yes."
"On the way to Yokohama?"
"Certainly."
Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong
boat; but, though he was really on the Carnatic, his master was
not there. He fell thunderstruck on a seat. He saw it all now. He
remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he
should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not
done so. It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had
missed the steamer. Yes, but it was still more the fault of the
traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain
the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk! He
now saw the detective's trick, and at this moment Mr. Fogg was
certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps
arrested and imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his
hair. Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of
accounts there would be!
After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and began
to study his situation. It was certainly not an enviable one. He
found himself on the way to Japan, and what should he do when he
got there? His pocket was empty. He had not a solitary shilling -
not so much as a penny. His passage had fortunately been paid for
in advance, and he had five or six days in which to decide upon
his future course. He fell to at meals with an appetite, and ate
for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and himself. He helped himself as generously
as if Japan were a desert, where nothing to eat was to be looked
for.
At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama.
This is an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the
mail-steamers, and those carrying travelers between North
America, China, Japan and the Oriental islands put in. It is
situated in the bay of Yeddo, and at but a short distance from
that second capital of the Japanese Empire, and the residence of
the Tycoon, the civil Emperor, before the Mikado, the spiritual
Emperor, absorbed his office in his own. The Carnatic anchored at
the quay near the customhouse, in the midst of a crowd of ships
bearing the flags of all nations.
Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of
the Sons of the Sun. He had nothing better to do than, taking
chance for his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of
Yokohama. He found himself at first in a thoroughly European
quarter, the houses having low fronts, and being adorned with
verandas, beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles.
This quarter occupied, with its streets, squares, docks and
warehouses, all the space between the "promontory of the Treaty"
and the river. Here, as at Hong Kong and Calcutta, were mixed
crowds of all races - Americans and English, Chinamen and
Dutchmen, mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything. The
Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had
dropped down in the midst of Hottentots.
He had, at least, one resource - to call on the French and
English consuls at Yokohama for assistance. But he shrank from
telling the story of his adventures, intimately connected as it
was with that of his master; and, before doing so, he determined
to exhaust all other means of aid. As chance did not favor him in
the European quarter, he penetrated that inhabited by the native
Japanese, determined, if necessary, to push on to Yeddo.
The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the
goddess of the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about.
There Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred
gates of a singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst
of bamboos and reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees. He
saw holy retreats where there were sheltered Buddhist priests and
sectaries of Confucius, and interminable streets, where a perfect
harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children, who looked as if
they had been cut out of Japanese screens, and who were playing
in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats, had been
gathered.
The streets were crowded with people. Priests were passing in
processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and
custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lace, and
carrying two sabres hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue
cotton with white stripes, and bearing guns; the Mikado's guards,
enveloped in silken doubles, hauberks and coats of mail; and
numbers of military folk of all ranks - for the military
profession is as much respected in Japan as it is despised in
China - went hither and thither in groups and pairs. Passepartout
saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims and simple
civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long
busts, slender legs, short stature and complexions varying from
copper-color to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese,
from whom the Japanese widely differ. He did not fail to observe
the curious equipages - carriages and palanquins, barrows
supplied with sails and litters made of bamboo; nor the women -
whom he thought not especially handsome - who took little steps
with their little feet, upon which they wore canvas shoes, straw
sandals and clogs of worked wood, and who displayed tight-looking
eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened and gowns crossed
with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind - an
ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed
from the dames of Japan.
Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this
motley crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious
shops, the jewelry establishments glittering with quaint Japanese
ornaments, the restaurants decked with streamers and banners, the
teahouses, where the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki,
a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice, and the
comfortable smoking houses, where they were puffing, not opium,
which is almost unknown in Japan, but a very fine, stringy
tobacco. He went on till he found himself in the fields, in the
midst of vast rice plantations. There he saw dazzling camellias
expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth their
last colors and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and within
bambooenclosures, cherry, plum and apple trees, which the
Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit,
and which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from
the sparrows, pigeons, ravens and other voracious birds. On the
branches of the cedars were perched large eagles. Amid the
foliage of the weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on
one leg. On every hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds and a
multitude of cranes, which the Japanese consider sacred, and
which to their minds symbolize long life and prosperity.
As he was strolling along, Passepartout saw some violets among
the shrubs.
"Good!" said he. "I'll have some supper."
But, on smelling them, he found that they were odorless.
"No chance there," thought he.
The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty
a breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic; but, as he
had been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were
growing. He observed that the butchers' stalls contained neither
mutton, goat, nor pork. Knowing also that it is a sacrilege to
kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made up
his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama - nor was
he mistaken. In default of butcher's meat, he could have wished
for a quarter of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails,
some game or fish, which, with rice, the Japanese eat almost
exclusively. But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart,
and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning.
Night came, and Passepartout re-entered the native quarter, where
he wandered through the streets, lit by vari-colored lanterns. He
looked on at the dancers, who were executing skillful steps and
boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open air with
their telescopes. Then he came to the harbor, which was lit up by
the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their
boats.
The streets at last became quiet. The patrol, the officers, in
splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites, succeeded the
bustling crowd. Passepartout thought they seemed like
ambassadors. Each time a company passed, Passepartout chuckled,
and said to himself: "Good! Another Japanese embassy departing
for Europe!"
Chapter 23
In Which Passepartout's Nose Becomes Outrageously Long
The next morning poor, jaded, famished Passepartout said to
himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards, and the
sooner he did so the better. He might, indeed, sell his watch;
but he would have starved first. Now or never he must use the
strong, if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon
him. He knew several French and English songs, and resolved to
try them upon the Japanese, who must be lovers of music, since
they were forever pounding on their cymbals, tam-tams and
tambourines. They could not but appreciate European talent.
It was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert,
and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might
not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado's
features. Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours.
As he was sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem
rather too well dressed for a wandering artist. The idea struck
him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his
project. In this manner he might also get a little money to
satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger. The resolution taken,
it remained to carry it out.
It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a
native dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange.
The man liked the European costume, and before long Passepartout
left his shop dressed in an old Japanese coat, and a sort of
one-sided turban, faded from long use. A few small pieces of
silver, moreover, jingled in his pocket.
"Good!" thought he. "I will imagine I am at the Carnival!"
His first care, after being thus "Japanesed," was to enter a
teahouse of modest appearance, and, upon half a bird and a little
rice, to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a
problem to be solved.
"Now," he thought, after he had eaten heartily, "I mustn't lose
my head. I can't sell this costume again for one still more
Japanese. I must consider how to leave this country of the Sun,
of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories, as
quickly as possible."
It occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to
leave for America. He would offer himself as a cook or servant,
in payment of his passage and meals. Once at San Francisco, he
would find some means of going on. The difficulty was, how to
travel the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which
lay between Japan and the New World.
Passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and
directed his steps towards the docks. But, as he approached them,
his project, which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow
more and more formidable to his mind. What need would they have
of a cook or servant on an American steamer, and what confidence
would they put in him, dressed as he was? What references could
he give?
As he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense
placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets.
This placard, which was in English, read as follows:
ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE,
HONORABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR,
LAST REPRESENTATIONS,
PRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE
UNITED STATES,
OF THE
LONG NOSES! LONG NOSES!
UNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE
OF THE GOD TINGOU!
GREAT ATTRACTION!
"The United States!" said Passepartout. "That's just what I
want!"
He followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the
Japanese quarter. A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a
large cabin, adorned with several clusters of streamers, the
exterior walls of which were designed to represent, in violent
colors and without perspective, a company of jugglers.
This was the Honorable William Batulcar's establishment. That
gentleman was a sort of Barnum, the director of a troupe of
mountebanks, jugglers, clowns, acrobats, equilibrists and
gymnasts, who, according to the placard, was giving his last
performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States
of the Union.
Passepartout entered and asked for Mr. Batulcar, who straightway
appeared in person.
"What do you want?" said he to Passepartout, whom he at first
took for a native.
"Would you like a servant, sir?" asked Passepartout.
"A servant!" cried Mr. Batulcar, caressing the thick grey beard
which hung from his chin. "I already have two who are obedient
and faithful, have never left me, and serve me for their
nourishment - and here they are," added he, holding out his two
robust arms, furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a
bass viol.
"So I can be of no use to you?"
"None."
"The devil! I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!"
"Ah!" said the Honorable Mr. Batulcar. "You are no more a
Japanese than I am a monkey! Why are you dressed up in that way?"
"A man dresses as he can."
"That's true. You are a Frenchman, aren't you?"
"Yes. A Parisian of Paris."
"Then you ought to know how to make grimaces?"
"Why," replied Passepartout, a little vexed that his nationality
should cause this question, "we Frenchmen know how to make
grimaces, it is true - but not any better than the Americans do."
"True. Well, if I can't take you as a servant, I can as a clown.
You see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in
foreign parts French clowns."
"Ah!"
"You are pretty strong, eh?"
"Especially after a good meal."
"And you can sing?"
"Yes," returned Passepartout, who had formerly sung in street
concerts.
"But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on
your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?"
"Humph! I think so," replied Passepartout, recalling the
exercises of his younger days.
"Well, that's enough," said the Honorable William Batulcar.
The engagement was concluded there and then.
Passepartout had at last found something to do. He was engaged to
act in the celebrated Japanese troupe. It was not a very
dignified position, but within a week he would be on his way to
San Francisco.
The performance, so noisily announced by the Honorable Mr.
Batulcar, was to commence at three o'clock, and soon the
deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the
door. Passepartout, though he had not been able to study or
rehearse a part, was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy
shoulders in the great exhibition of the "human pyramid,"
executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This "great
attraction" was to close the performance.
Before three o'clock the large shed was crowded with spectators,
Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and
children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and
into the boxes opposite the stage. The musicians took up a
position inside, and were vigorously performing on their gongs,
tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines and immense drums.
The performance was much like all acrobatic displays. But it must
be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the
world.
One, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful
trick of the butterflies and the flowers. Another traced in the
air, with the odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words,
which composed a compliment to the audience. A third juggled with
some lighted candles, which he extinguished successively as they
passed his lips, and relit again without interrupting for an
instant his juggling. Another reproduced the most singular
combinations with a spinning-top. In his hands the revolving tops
seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their
interminable whirling. They ran over pipe-stems, the edges of
sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage. They
turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo
ladders, dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange
musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of
tone. The jugglers tossed them in the air, threw them like
shuttlecocks with wooden battledores, and yet they kept on
spinning; they put them into their pockets, and took them out
still whirling as before.
It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the
acrobats and gymnasts. The turning on ladders, poles, balls,
barrels, etc., was executed with wonderful precision.
But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long
Noses, a show to which Europe is as yet a stranger.
The Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct
patronage of the god Tingou. Attired after the fashion of the
Middle Ages, they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of
wings. But what especially distinguished them was the long noses
which were fastened to their faces, and the uses which they made
of them. These noses were made of bamboo, and were five, six and
even ten feet long, some straight, others curved, some ribboned
and some having imitation warts upon them. It was upon these
appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses, that they
performed their gymnastic exercises. A dozen of these sectaries
of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to
represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses,
jumping from one to another, and performing the most skillful
leapings and somersaults.
As a last scene, a "human pyramid" had been announced, in which
fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. But,
instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other's shoulders,
the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses. It
happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of
the Car had left the troupe, and as, to fill this part, only
strength and adroitness were necessary, Passepartout had been
chosen to take his place.
The poor fellow really felt sad when - melancholy reminiscence of
his youth! - he donned his costume, adorned with vari-colored
wings, and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet
long. But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was
winning him something to eat.
He went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who
were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut. They all
stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the
ceiling. A second group of artists stood on these long
appendages, then a third above these, then a fourth, until a
human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon
arose on top of the noses. This elicited loud applause, in the
midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening
air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was lost, one of the
lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human monument was
shattered like a castle built of cards!
It was Passepartout's fault. Abandoning his position, clearing
the footlights without the aid of his wings, and clambering up to
the right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the
spectators, crying, "Ah, my master! My master!"
"You here?"
"Myself."
"Very well; then let us go to the steamer, young man!"
Mr. Fogg, Aouda and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the
theatre to the outside, where they encountered the Honorable Mr.
Batulcar, furious with rage. He demanded damages for the
"breakage" of the pyramid; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by
giving him a handful of banknotes.
At half-past six, the very hour of departure, Mr. Fogg and Aouda,
followed by Passepartout, who in his hurry had retained his wings
and nose six feet long, stepped upon the American steamer.
Chapter 24
During Which Mr. Fogg and Party Cross the Pacific Ocean
What happened when the pilot boat came in sight of Shanghai will
be easily guessed. The signals made by the Tankadere had been
seen by the captain of the Yokohama steamer, who, seeing the flag
at half-mast, had directed his course towards the little craft.
Phileas Fogg, after paying the stipulated price of his passage to
John Bunsby, and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of
five hundred and fifty pounds, boarded the steamer with Aouda and
Fix; and they started at once for Nagasaki and Yokohama.
They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of
November. Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the
Carnatic, where he learned, to Aouda's great delight - and
perhaps to his own, though he betrayed no emotion - that
Passepartout, a Frenchman, had really arrived on her the day
before.
The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very
evening, and it became necessary to find Passepartout, if
possible, without delay. Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French
and English consuls, and, after wandering through the streets a
long time, began to despair of finding his missing servant.
Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at last led him into
the Honorable Mr. Batulcar's theatre. He certainly would not have
recognized Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank's costume;
but the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the
gallery. He could not help starting, which so changed the
position of his nose as to bring the "pyramid" pell-mell upon the
stage.
All this Passepartout learned from Aouda, who told him what had
taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the
Tankadere, in company with one Mr. Fix.
Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name. He
thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his
master what had taken place between the detective and himself. In
the account he gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for
having become drunk smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong.
Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word. Then he
furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in
harmony with his position. Within an hour the Frenchman had cut
off his nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing
about him which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou.
The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San
Francisco belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and
was named the General Grant. She was a large paddle-wheel steamer
of two thousand five hundred tons, well-equipped and very fast.
The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck. At one end
a piston-rod worked up and down. At the other was a
connecting-rod which, in changing the rectilinear motion to a
circular one, was directly connected with the shaft of the
paddles. The General Grant was rigged with three masts, giving a
large capacity for sails, and thus materially aiding the steam
power. By making twelve miles an hour, she would cross the ocean
in twenty-one days. Phileas Fogg was therefore justified in
hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of December,
New York by the 11th, and London on the 20th - thus gaining
several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December.
There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them
English, many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way
to California, and several East Indian officers, who were
spending their vacation in making a tour of the world. Nothing of
moment happened on the voyage. The steamer, sustained on its
large paddles, rolled but little, and the Pacific almost
justified its name.
Mr. Fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever. His young companion
felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than
gratitude. His silent but generous nature impressed her more than
she thought; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to
emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her
protector. Aouda took the keenest interest in his plans, and
became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard
his journey.
She often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive
the state of the lady's heart. Being the most faithful of
servants, he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg's
honesty, generosity and devotion. He took pains to calm Aouda's
doubts of a successful termination of the journey, telling her
that the most difficult part of it had passed, that now they were
beyond the fantastic countries of Japan and China, and were
fairly on their way to civilized places again. A railway train
from San Francisco to New York, and a transatlantic steamer from
New York to Liverpool, would doubtless bring them to the end of
this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed
upon.
On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had
traveled exactly one half of the terrestrial globe. The General
Grant passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and
eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr.
Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in
which he was to complete the tour, and there were only
twenty-eight left. But, though he was only halfway by the
difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of
the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits
from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to
Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed
without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London,
the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand
miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of
locomotion, to travel twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on
the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand five
hundred. And now the course was a straight one, and Fix was no
longer there to put obstacles in their way!
It happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made
a joyful discovery. It will be remembered that the obstinate
fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London
time, and on regarding that of the countries he had passed
through as quite false and unreliable. Now, on this day, though
he had not changed the hands, he found that his watch exactly
agreed with the ship's chronometers. His triumph was hilarious.
He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard!
"The rogue told me a lot of stories," repeated Passepartout,
"about the meridians, the sun, and the moon! Moon, indeed!
Moonshine more likely! If one listened to that sort of people, a
pretty sort of time one would keep! I was sure that the sun would
some day regulate itself by my watch!"
Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been
divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would
have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would
then, instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning,
indicate nine o'clock in the evening. That is, it would have
shown the twenty-first hour after midnight - precisely the
difference between London time and that of the one hundred and
eightieth meridian. But if Fix had been able to explain this
purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted it,
even if he had comprehended it. Moreover, if the detective had
been on board at that moment, Passepartout would have joined
issue with him on a quite different subject, and in an entirely
different manner.
Where was Fix at that moment?
He was actually on board the General Grant.
On reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom he
expected to meet again during the day, had repaired at once to
the English consulate, where he at last found the warrant of
arrest. It had followed him from Bombay, and had come by the
Carnatic, on which steamer he himself was supposed to be. Fix's
disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant
was now useless. Mr. Fogg had left English ground, and it was now
necessary to procure his extradition!
"Well," thought Fix, after a moment of anger, "my warrant is not
good here, but it will be in England. The rogue evidently intends
to return to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police
off his track. Good! I will follow him across the Atlantic. As
for the money, heaven grant there may be some left! But the
fellow has already spent in traveling, rewards, trials, bail,
elephants and all sorts of charges, more than five thousand
pounds. Yet, after all, the bank is rich!"
His course decided on, he went on board the General Grant, and
was there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived. To his utter
amazement, he recognized Passepartout, despite his theatrical
disguise. He quickly concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an
awkward explanation, and hoped - thanks to the number of
passengers -to remain unperceived by Mr. Fogg's servant.
On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on
the forward deck. The latter, without a word, made a rush for
him, grasped him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a
group of Americans, who immediately began to bet on him,
administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows, which
proved the great superiority of French over English pugilistic
skill.
When Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and
comforted. Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and,
looking at his adversary, coldly said, "Have you done?"
"For this time - yes."
"Then let me have a word with you."
"But I -"
"In your master's interests."
Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix's coolness, for he
quietly followed him, and they sat down aside from the rest of
the passengers.
"You have given me a thrashing," said Fix. "Good, I expected it.
Now, listen to me. Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg's
adversary. I am now in his game."
"Aha!" cried Passepartout. "You are convinced he is an honest
man?"
"No," replied Fix coldly, "I think him a rascal. Sh! don't budge,
and let me speak. As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it
was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of
arrest arrived. I did everything I could to keep him back. I sent
the Bombay priests after him. I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong.
I separated you from him, and I made him miss the Yokohama
steamer."
Passepartout listened, with closed fists.
"Now," resumed Fix, "Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England.
Well, I will follow him there. But hereafter I will do as much to
keep obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to
put them in his path. I've changed my game, you see, and simply
because it was in my interest to change it. Your interest is the
same as mine, for it is only in England that you will know
whether you are in the service of a criminal or an honest man."
Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix, and was convinced
that he spoke with entire good faith.
"Are we friends?" asked the detective.
"Friends? No," replied Passepartout. "But allies, perhaps. At the
least sign of treason, however, I'll twist your neck for you.
"Agreed," said the detective quietly.
Eleven days later, on the 3rd of December, the General Grant
entered the bay of the Golden Gate, and reached San Francisco.
Mr. Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day.
Chapter 25
In Which a Slight Glimpse Is Had of San Francisco
It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg, Aouda and
Passepartout set foot upon the American continent, if this name
can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked.
These quays, rising and falling with the tide, thus facilitate
the loading and unloading of vessels. Alongside them were
clippers of all sizes, steamers of all nationalities, and the
steamboats, with several decks rising one above the other, which
ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries. There were also heaped
up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico, Chili,
Peru, Brazil, Europe, Asia and all the Pacific islands.
Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American
continent, thought he would show it by executing a perilous vault
in fine style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell
through them. Put out of countenance by the manner in which he
thus "set foot" upon the New World, he uttered a loud cry. This
so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are
always perched upon these movable quays, that they flew noisily
away.
Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour
the first train left for New York, and learned that this was at
six o'clock P.M. He had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the
Californian city. Taking a carriage for three dollars, he and
Aouda entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the
driver, and they set out for the International Hotel.
From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much
curiosity the wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the
Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden
and brick warehouses, the numerous conveyances, omnibuses,
horse-cars, and upon the side-walks, not only Americans and
Europeans, but Chinese and Indians. Passepartout was surprised at
all he saw. San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of
1849 - a city of banditti, assassins and incendiaries, who had
flocked here in crowds in pursuit of plunder. Formerly a paradise
of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in one
hand and a bowie-knife in the other, it was now a great
commercial emporium.
The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of
the streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles,
and in the midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares.
Beyond appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the
Celestial Empire in a toy-box. Sombreros and red shirts and
plumed Indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats
and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously
active, gentlemanly-looking men. Some of the streets -especially
Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco what Regent Street
is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris and Broadway to
New York - were lined with splendid and spacious stores, which
exposed in their windows the products of the entire world.
When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not
seem to him as if he had left England at all.
The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort
of restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of
dried beef, oyster soup, biscuits and cheese, without taking out
their purses. Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or
sherry which was drunk. This seemed "very American" to
Passepartout. The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and
Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing themselves at a table, were
abundantly served on diminutive plates by Negroes of darkest hue.
After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the
English consulate to have his passport visaed. As he was going
out, he met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well,
before taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield
rifles and Colt's revolvers. He had been listening to stories of
attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees. Mr. Fogg
thought it a useless precaution, but told him to do as he thought
best, and went on to the consulate.
He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, "by the
greatest chance in the world," he met Fix. The detective seemed
wholly taken by surprise. What! Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed
the Pacific together, and not met on the steamer! At least Fix
felt honored to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so
much, and, as his business recalled him to Europe, he should be
delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company.
Mr. Fogg replied that the honor would be his; and the detective -
who was determined not to lose sight of him - begged permission
to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco - a request
which Mr. Fogg readily granted.
They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great
crowd was collected. The side-walks, street, horse-car rails, the
shop-doors, the windows of the houses and even the roofs, were
full of people. Men were going about carrying large posters, and
flags and streamers were floating in the wind, while loud cries
were heard on every hand.
"Hurrah for Camerfield!"
"Hurrah for Mandiboy!"
It was a political meeting; at least so Fix guessed. He said to
Mr. Fogg, "Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd. There
may be danger in it."
"Yes," returned Mr. Fogg, "and blows, even if they are political
are still blows."
Fix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see
without being jostled about, the party took up a position on the
top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery
Street. Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a
coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been
erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd
seemed to be directed.
For what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of this
excited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to
nominate some high official - a governor or member of Congress?
It was not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them.
Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass.
All the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed,
seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries-an
energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed
back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then
reappeared in tatters. The undulations of the human surge reached
the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a
sea agitated by a squall. Many of the black hats disappeared, and
the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in
height.
"It is evidently a meeting," said Fix, "and its object must be an
exciting one. I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama,
despite the fact that that question is settled."
"Perhaps," replied Mr. Fogg, simply.
"At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the
Honorable Mr. Camerfield and the Honorable Mr. Mandiboy."
Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg's arm, observed the tumultuous scene
with surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of
it all was. Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose.
Hurrahs and excited shouts were heard. The staffs of the banners
began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in
every direction. Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the
carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd.
Boots and shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr. Fogg
thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din.
The rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower step.
One of the parties had evidently been repulsed, but the mere
onlookers could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had
gained the upper hand.
"It would be prudent for us to retire," said Fix, who was anxious
that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they
got back to London. "If there is any question about England in
all this, and we were recognized, I fear it would go hard with
us."
"An English subject - " began Mr. Fogg.
He did not finish his sentence, for a terrific hubbub now arose
on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and
there were frantic shouts of, "Hurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, hip,
hurrah!"
It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and
taking the Camerfield forces in flank. Mr. Fogg, Aouda and Fix
found themselves between two fires. It was too late to escape.
The torrent of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was
irresistible. Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their
attempts to protect their fair companion. The former, as cool as
ever, tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has
placed at the end of every Englishman's arm, but in vain. A big
brawny fellow with a red beard, flushed face and broad shoulders,
who seemed to be the chief of the band, raised his clenched fist
to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing blow, had
not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead. An enormous
bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective's silk
hat, which was completely smashed in.
"Yankee!" exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the
ruffian.
"Englishman!" returned the other. "We will meet again!"
"When you please."
"What is your name?"
"Phileas Fogg. And yours?"
"Colonel Stamp Proctor."
The human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily
got upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes. Happily,
he was not seriously hurt. His traveling overcoat was divided
into two unequal parts, and his trousers resembled those of
certain Indians, which fit less compactly than they are easy to
put on. Aouda had escaped unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of
the fray in his black and blue bruise.
"Thanks," said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were
out of the crowd.
"No thanks are necessary," replied Fix, "but let us go."
"Where?"
"To a tailor's."
Such a visit was, indeed, necessary. The clothing of both Mr.
Fogg and Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively
engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy. An hour
after, they were once more suitably attired, and with Aouda
returned to the International Hotel.
Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen
six-barreled revolvers. When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows;
but Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure,
his countenance resumed its placid expression. Fix evidently was
no longer an enemy, but an ally. He was faith-fully keeping his
word.
Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and
their luggage to the station drew up to the door. As he was
getting in, Mr. Fogg said to Fix, "You have not seen this Colonel
Proctor again?"
"No."
"I will come back to America to find him," said Phileas Fogg
calmly. "It would not be right for an Englishman to permit
himself to be treated in that way without retaliating."
The detective smiled, but did not reply. It was clear that Mr.
Fogg was one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate
dueling at home, fight abroad when their honor is attacked.
At a quarter before six the travelers reached the station, and
found the train ready to depart. As he was about to enter it, Mr.
Fogg called a porter, and said to him: "My friend, was there not
some trouble today in San Francisco?"
"It was a political meeting, sir," replied the porter.
"But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the
streets."
"It was only a meeting assembled for an election."
"The election of a general-in-chief, no doubt?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"No, sir; of a justice of the peace."
Phileas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full speed.
Chapter 26
In Which Phileas Fogg and Party Travel by the Pacific Railroad
"From ocean to ocean" - so say the Americans; and these four
words compose the general designation of the "great trunk line"
which crosses the entire width of the United States. The Pacific
Railroad is, however, really divided into two distinct lines: the
Central Pacific, between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union
Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. Five main lines connect Omaha
with New York.
New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted
metal ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven
hundred and eighty-six miles. Between Omaha and the Pacific the
railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians
and wild beasts, and a large tract which the Mormons, after they
were driven from Illinois in 1845, began to colonize.
The journey from New York to San Francisco took, formerly, under
the most favorable conditions, at least six months. It is now
accomplished in seven days. In 1862, in spite of the Southern
Members of Congress, who wished a more southerly route, it was
decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second
parallels. President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at
Omaha, in Nebraska. The work was started at once and pursued with
true American energy. The rapidity with which it went on did not
injuriously affect its good execution. The road grew, on the
prairies, a mile and a half a day. A locomotive, running on the
rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid
the next day, and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in
position.
The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa,
Kansas, Colorado and Oregon. On leaving Omaha, it passes along
the left bank of the Platte Rivet as far as the junction of its
northern branch, follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie
territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake,
and reaches Salt Lake City, the Mormon capital, plunges into the
Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt
Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and descends, via Sacramento, to
the Pacific - its grade, even on the Rocky Mountains, never
exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile.
Such was the road to be traveled in seven days. It would enable
Phileas Fogg - at least, so he hoped - to take the Atlantic
steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool.
The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight
wheels, with no compartments in the interior. It was supplied
with two rows of seats, perpendicular to the direction of the
train on either side of an aisle which led to the front and rear
platforms. These platforms were found throughout the train, and
the passengers were able to pass from one end of the train to the
other. It was supplied with saloon cars, balcony cars,
restaurants and smoking-cars. Theatre cars alone were missing,
and they will have these some day.
Book and news dealers, sellers of edibles, beverages and cigars,
who seemed to have plenty of customers, were continually
circulating in the aisles.
The train left Oakland station at six o'clock. It was already
night, cold and cheerless, the heavens being overcast with clouds
which seemed to threaten snow. The train did not proceed rapidly.
Counting the stops, it did not run more than twenty miles an
hour, which was a sufficient speed, however, to enable it to
reach Omaha within its designated time.
There was but little conversation in the car, and soon many of
the passengers were asleep. Passepartout found himself beside the
detective, but he did not talk to him. After recent events, their
relations with each other had grown somewhat cold. There could no
longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them. Fix's manner
had not changed; but Passepartout was very reserved, and ready to
strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation.
Snow began to fall an hour after they started, a fine snow,
however, which happily did not deter the train. Nothing could be
seen from the windows but a vast, white sheet, against which the
smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect.
At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that
bedtime had arrived. In a few minutes the car was transformed
into a dormitory. The backs of the seats were thrown back,
bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious
system, berths were suddenly improvised, and each traveler soon
had at his disposition a comfortable bed, protected from curious
eyes by thick curtains. The sheets were clean and the pillows
soft. It only remained to go to bed and sleep - which everybody
did - while the train sped on across the State of California.
The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very
hilly. The Central Pacific, taking Sacramento for its starting
point, extends eastward to meet the road from Omaha. The line
from San Francisco to Sacramento runs in a northeasterly
direction, along the American River, which empties into San Pablo
Bay. The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were
accomplished in six hours. Towards midnight, while fast asleep,
the travelers passed through Sacramento; so that they saw nothing
of that important place, the seat of the state government, with
its fine quays, its broad streets, its noble hotels, squares and
churches.
The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction,
Roclin, Auburn and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra
Nevada. 'Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour
later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car, and the
travelers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain
region through which they were steaming. The railway track wound
in and out among the passes, now approaching the mountainsides,
now suspended over precipices, avoiding abrupt angles by bold
curves, plunging into narrow defiles, which seemed to have no
outlet. The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a weird light,
with its sharp bell, and its cowcatcher extended like a spur,
mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and
cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic
pines.
There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route. The
railway turned around the sides of the mountains, and did not
attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one
point to another.
The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley
about nine o'clock, going always northeasterly. At midday it
reached Reno where there was a delay of twenty minutes for
breakfast.
From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed
northward for several miles by its banks. Then it turned
eastward, and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt
Range, nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada.
After breakfast, Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places
in the car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded as
they passed along: the vast prairies, the mountains lining the
horizon, and the creeks, with their frothy, foaming streams.
Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes, massing together in the
distance, seemed like a movable dam. These innumerable
multitudes of beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the
passage of the trains. Thousands of them have been seen passing
over the track for hours in compact ranks. The locomotive is then
forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear.
This happened to the train in which Mr. Fogg was traveling. About
twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo
covered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
clear the way with its cowcatcher; but the mass of animals was
too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait,
uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of
interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
nothing can moderate and change their course. It is a torrent of
living flesh which no dam could contain.
The travelers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms.
But Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a
hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it
should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
Passepartout was furious at the delay, and longed to discharge
his arsenal of revolvers upon them.
"What a country!" he cried. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go
by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel!
Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in
his program! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the
locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was
wise. He would have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with
the cowcatcher; but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon
have been checked, the train would inevitably have been thrown
off the track, and would then have been helpless.
The best course was to wait patiently, and regain the lost time
by greater speed when the obstacle was removed. The procession of
buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the
track was clear. The last ranks of the herd were now passing over
the rails, while the first had already disappeared below the
southern horizon.
It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of
the Humboldt Range, and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah,
the region of the Great Salt Lake, the singular colony of the
Mormons.
Chapter 27
In Which Passepartout Undergoes, at a Speed of
Twenty Miles an Hour, a Course of Mormon History
During the night of the 5th of December, the train ran
south-easterly for about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance
in a northeasterly direction, towards the Great Salt Lake.
Passepartout, about nine o'clock, went out upon the platform to
take the air. The weather was cold, the heavens grey, but it was
not snowing. The sun's disc, enlarged by the mist, seemed an
enormous ring of gold, and Passepartout was amusing himself by
calculating its value in pounds sterling, when he was diverted
from this interesting study by a strange-looking person who made
his appearance on the platform.
This person, who had taken the train at Elko, was tall and dark,
with black moustache, black stockings, a black silk hat, a black
waistcoat, black trousers, a white cravat and dogskin gloves. He
might have been taken for a clergyman. He went from one end of
the train to the other, and affixed to the door of each car a
notice written in manuscript.
Passepartout approached and read one of these notices. It stated
that Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary, taking advantage of
his presence on train No.48, would deliver a lecture on Mormonism
in car No.117, from eleven to twelve o'clock; and that he invited
all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the
mysteries of the religion of the "Latter Day Saints" to attend.
"I'll go," said Passepartout to himself. He knew nothing of
Mormonism except the custom of polygamy, which is its foundation.
The news quickly spread through the train, which contained about
one hundred passengers, thirty of whom, at most, attracted by the
notice, seated themselves in car No.117. Passepartout took one of
the front seats. Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend.
At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an
irritated voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, "I
tell you that Joe Smith is a martyr, that his brother Hiram is a
martyr, and that the persecutions of the United States Government
against the prophets will also make a martyr of Brigham Young.
Who dares to say the contrary?"
No one ventured to contradict the missionary, whose excited tone
contrasted curiously with his naturally calm expression. No doubt
his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were
actually subjected. The government had just succeeded, with some
difficulty, in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule.
It had made itself master of Utah, and subjected that territory
to the laws of the Union, after imprisoning Brigham Young on a
charge of rebellion and polygamy. The disciples of the prophet
had since redoubled their efforts, and resisted, by words at
least, the authority of Congress. Elder Hitch, as is seen, was
trying to make proselytes on the railway trains.
Then, emphasizing his words with his loud voice and frequent
gestures, he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical
times. He told how in Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of
Joseph published the annals of the new religion, and bequeathed
them to his Mormon son; how, many centuries later, a translation
of this precious book, which was written in Egyptian, was made by
Joseph Smith, Jr., a Vermont farmer, who revealed himself as a
mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the celestial
messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave him
the annals of the Lord.
Several of the audience, not being much interested in the
missionary's narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch,
continuing his lecture, related how Smith, Jr., with his father,
two brothers, and a few disciples, founded the church of the
"Latter Day Saints," which, adopted not only in America, but in
England, Norway and Sweden and Germany, counts many artisans, as
well as men engaged in the liberal professions, among its
members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a temple erected
there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a town built
at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and
received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by
Abraham and several famous Egyptians.
The Elder's story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience
grew gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers.
But this did not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with
the story of Joseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837, and how his
ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers; his
reappearance some years afterwards, more honorable and honored
than ever, at Independence, Missouri, the chief of a flourishing
colony of three thousand disciples, and his pursuit thence by
outraged Gentiles, and retirement in the Far West.
Ten hearers only were now left, among them honest Passepartout,
who was listening with all ears. Thus he learned that, after long
persecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded a
community at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five
thousand souls, of which he became mayor, chief justice and
general-in-chief; that he announced himself, in 1843, as a
candidate for the Presidency of the United States; and that
finally, being drawn into ambush at Carthage, he was thrown into
prison, and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks.
Passepartout was now the only person left in the car. The Elder,
looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years after
the assassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, Brigham
Young, his successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt
Lake, where, in the midst of that fertile region, directly on the
route of the emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to
California, the new colony, thanks to the polygamy practised by
the Mormons, had flourished beyond expectations.
"And this," added Elder William Hitch, "is why the jealousy of
Congress has been aroused against us! Why have the soldiers of
the Union invaded the soil of Utah? Why has Brigham Young, our
chief, been imprisoned, in contempt of all justice? Shall we
yield to force? Never! Driven from Vermont, driven from
Illinois, driven from Ohio, driven from Missouri, driven from
Utah, we shall yet find some independent territory on which to
plant our tents. And you, my brother," continued the Elder,
fixing his angry eyes upon his single hearer, "will you not plant
yours there, too, under the shadow of our flag?"
"No!" replied Passepartout courageously, in his turn retiring
from the car, and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy.
During the lecture the train had been making good progress, and
towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the
Great Salt Lake. Here the passengers could observe the vast
extent of this interior sea, which is also called the Dead Sea,
and into which flows an American Jordan. It is a picturesque
lake, framed in lofty crags in large strata, encrusted with white
salt - a superb sheet of water, which was formerly of larger
space than now, its shores having encroached with the lapse of
time, and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its
depth.
The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is
situated three miles, eight hundred feet above the sea. Quite
different from Lake Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve
hundred feet below the sea, it contains considerable salt, and
one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter, its
specific weight being 1,170, and, after being distilled, 1,000.
Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it, and those which
descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and other streams soon
perish.
The country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons
are mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated
animals, fields of wheat, corn and other cereals, luxuriant
prairies, hedges of wild rose, clumps of acacias and milk-wort,
would have been seen six months later. Now the ground was covered
with a thin powdering of snow.
The train reached Ogden at two o'clock, where it rested for six
hours. Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt
Lake City, connected with Ogden by a branch road. They spent two
hours in this strikingly American town, built on the pattern of
other cities of the Union, like a checker-board, "with the
sombre sadness of right-angles," as Victor Hugo expresses it. The
founder of the City of the Saints could not escape from the taste
for symmetry which distinguishes the Anglo-Saxons. In this
strange country, where the people are certainly not up to the
level of their institutions, everything is done "squarely" -
cities, houses and follies.
The travelers, then, were promenading, at three o'clock, about
the streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and
the spurs of the Wahsatch Range. They saw few or no churches, but
the prophet's mansion, the courthouse, and the arsenal,
blue-brick houses with verandas and porches, surrounded by
gardens bordered with acacias, palms and locusts. A clay and
pebble wall, built in 1853, surrounded the town. In the principal
street were the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions.
The place did not seem thickly populated. The streets were almost
deserted, except in the vicinity of the temple, which they only
reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by
palisades. There were many women, which was easily accounted for
by the "peculiar institution" of the Mormons; but it must not be
supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists. They are free to
marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is
mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as,
according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted
to the possession of its highest joys. These poor creatures
seemed to be neither well off nor happy. Some -the more
well-to-do, no doubt -wore short, open black silk dresses, under
a hood or modest shawl; others were clothed in Indian fashion.
Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these
women, charged, in groups; with conferring happiness on a single
Mormon. His common sense pitied, above all, the husband. It
seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at
once across the vicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it
were, in a body to the Mormon paradise, with the prospect of
seeing them in the company of the glorious Smith, who doubtless
was the chief ornament of that delightful place, to all eternity.
He felt decidedly repelled from such a vocation, and he imagined
- perhaps he was mistaken - that the fair ones of Salt Lake City
cast rather alarming glances on his person. Happily, his stay
there was but brief. At four the party found themselves again at
the station, took their places in the train, and the whistle
sounded for starting. Just at the moment however, that the
locomotive wheels began to move, cries of "Stop! Stop!" were
heard.
Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one. The gentleman who
uttered the cries was evidently a belated Mormon. He was
breathless with running. Happily for him, the station had
neither gates nor barriers. He rushed along the track, jumped on
the rear platform of the train, and fell, exhausted, into one of
the seats.
Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur
gymnast, approached him with lively interest, and learned that he
had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene.
When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured
to ask him politely how many wives he had; for, from the manner
in which he had decamped, it might be thought that he had twenty
at least.
"One, sir," replied the Mormon, raising his arms heavenward -
"one, and that is enough!"
Chapter 28
In Which Passepartout Does Not Succeed
in Making Anybody Listen to Reason
The train, on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden, passed northward
for an hour as far as Weber River, having completed nearly nine
hundred miles from San Francisco. From this point it took an
easterly direction towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains. It was
in the section included between this range and the Rocky
Mountains that the American engineers found the most formidable
difficulties in laying the road, and that the government granted
a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile, instead of
sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains. But the
engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided its difficulties
by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks. One tunnel
only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order to
arrive at the great basin.
The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at
the Great Salt Lake. From this point it described a long curve,
descending towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the
dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the
Pacific. There were many creeks in this mountainous region, and
it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek, Green Creek and others,
upon culverts.
Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while
Fix longed to get out of this difficult region, and was more
anxious than Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of
delays and accidents, and set foot on English soil.
At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger
station, and twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory,
following the valley of Bitter Creek throughout. The next day,
December 7th, they stopped for a quarter of an hour at Green
River station. Snow had fallen heavily during the night, but,
being mixed with rain, it had half melted, and did not interrupt
their progress. The bad weather, however, annoyed Passepartout;
for the accumulation of snow, by blocking the wheels of the cars,
would certainly have been fatal to Mr. Fogg's tour.
"What an idea!" he said to himself. "Why did my master make this
journey in winter? Couldn't he have waited for the good season to
increase his chances?"
While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky
and the depression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing
fears from a totally different cause.
Several passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking
up and down the platforms. Among these Aouda recognized Colonel
Stamp Proctor, the same man who had so grossly insulted Phileas
Fogg at the San Francisco meeting. Not wishing to be recognized,
the young woman drew back from the window, feeling much alarm at
her discovery. She was attached to the man who, however
coldly, gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion.
She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth of the sentiment with
which her protector inspired her, which she called gratitude,
but which, though she was unconscious of it, was really more than
that. Her heart sank within her when she recognized the man whom
Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for his
conduct. Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor
on this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all
hazards, that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary.
Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and
Passepartout whom she had seen.
"That Proctor on this train!" cried Fix. "Well, reassure
yourself, madam. Before he settles with Mr. Fogg, he has got to
deal with me! It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the
two."
"And, besides," added Passepartout, "I'll take charge of him,
colonel as he is."
"Mr. Fix," resumed Aouda, "Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge
him. He said that he would come back to America to find this man.
Should he perceive Colonel Proctor, we could not prevent a
collision which might have terrible results. He must not see
him."
"You are right, madam," replied Fix. "A meeting between them
might ruin all. Whether he were victorious or beaten, Mr. Fogg
would be delayed, and -"
"And," added Passepartout, "that would play the game of the
gentlemen of the Reform Club. In four days we shall be in New
York. Well, if my master does not leave this car during those
four days, we may hope that chance will not bring him face to
face with this confounded American. We must, if possible, prevent
his stirring out of it."
The conversation dropped. Mr. Fogg had just awakened, and was
looking out of the window. Soon after Passepartout, without being
heard by his master or Aouda, whispered to the detective, "Would
you really fight for him?"
"I would do anything," replied Fix, in a tone which betrayed
determined will, "to get him back living to Europe!"
Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his
frame, but his confidence in his master remained unbroken.
Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a
meeting between him and the colonel? It ought not to be a
difficult task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and
little curious. The detective, at least, seemed to have found a
way; for, after a few moments, he said to Mr. Fogg, "These are
long and slow hours, sir, that we are passing on the railway."
"Yes," replied Mr. Fogg, "but they pass."
"You were in the habit of playing whist," resumed Fix, "on the
steamers."
"Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here. I have neither
cards nor partners."
"Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all
the American trains. And as for partners, if madam plays -"
"Certainly, sir," Aouda quickly replied, "I understand whist. It
is part of an English education."
"I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game. Well,
here are three of us, and a dummy -"
"As you please, sir," replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to
resume his favorite pastime - even on the railway.
Passepartout was despatched in search of the steward, and soon
returned with two packs of cards, some pins, counters and a shelf
covered with cloth.
The game commenced. Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and
even received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg. As
for the detective, he was adept, and worthy of being matched
against his present opponent.
"Now," thought Passepartout, "we've got him. He won't budge."
At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge
of the waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and
twenty-four feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest
points attained by the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains.
After going about two hundred miles, the travelers at last found
themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the
Atlantic, and which nature has made so propitious for laying the
iron road.
On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams,
branches of the North Platte River, already appeared. The whole
northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense
semi-circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of
the Rocky Mountains, the highest being Laramie Peak. Between this
and the railway extended vast plains, plentifully irrigated. On
the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which
extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas River, one of
the great tributaries of the Missouri.
At half-past twelve the travelers caught sight for an instant of
Fort Halleck, which commands that section. In a few more hours
the Rocky Mountains were crossed. There was reason to hope, then,
that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult
country. The snow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp
and cold. Large birds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and
flew off in the distance. No wild beast appeared on the plain. It
was a desert in its vast nakedness.
After a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr. Fogg and
his partners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was
heard, and the train stopped. Passepartout put his head out of
the door, but saw nothing to cause the delay. No station was in
view.
Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to
get out, but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his
servant, "See what is the matter."
Passepartout rushed out of the car. Thirty or forty passengers
had already descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor.
The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way.
The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a
signal-man, whom the station-master at Medicine Bow, the next
stopping place, had sent on before. The passengers drew around
and took part in the discussion, in which Colonel Proctor, with
his insolent manner, was conspicuous.
Passepartout, joining the group, heard the signal-man say, "No!
You can't pass. The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would
not bear the weight of the train."
This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a
mile from the place where they now were. According to the
signal-man, it was in a ruinous condition, several of the iron
wires being broken; and it was impossible to risk the passage. He
did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge. It may
be taken for granted that, rash as the Americans usually are,
when they are prudent there is good reason for it.
Passepartout, not daring to tell his master what he heard,
listened with set teeth, immovable as a statue.
"Hum!" cried Colonel Proctor, "but we are not going to stay here,
I imagine, and take root in the Snow?"
"Colonel," replied the conductor, "we have telegraphed to Omaha
for a train, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow
in less than six hours."
"Six hours!" cried Passepartout.
"Certainly," returned the conductor, "besides, it will take us as
long as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot."
"But it is only a mile from here," said one of the passengers.
"Yes, but it's on the other side of the river."
"And can't we cross that in a boat?" asked the colonel.
"That's impossible. The creek is swelled by the rains. It is a
rapid, and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the
north to find a ford."
The colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway
company and the conductor. Passepartout, who was furious, could
not help but agree with him. Here was an obstacle, indeed, which
all his master's banknotes could not remove.
There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who,
without reckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge
fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow. They grumbled and
protested, and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg's
attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game.
Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master
what had occurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning
towards the car, when the engineer - a true Yankee, named Forster
- called out, "Gentlemen, perhaps there is a way, after all, to
get over."
"On the bridge?" asked a passenger.
"On the bridge."
"With our train?"
"With our train."
Passepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer.
"But the bridge is unsafe," urged the conductor.
"No matter," replied Forster; "I think that by putting on the
very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over."
"The devil!" muttered Passepartout.
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the
engineer's proposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially
delighted, and found the plan a very feasible one. He told
stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without
bridges, by putting on full steam; and many of those present
avowed themselves of the engineer's mind.
"We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over," said
one.
"Eighty! ninety!"
Passepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything
to get over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a
little too American. "Besides," thought he, "there's a still more
simple way, and it does not even occur to any of these people!
Sir," said he aloud to one of the passengers, "the engineer's
plan seems to me a little dangerous, but -"
"Eighty chances!" replied the passenger, turning his back on him.
"I know it," said Passepartout, turning to another passenger,
"but a simple idea -"
"Ideas are no use," returned the American, shrugging his
shoulders, "as the engineer assures us that we can pass."
"Doubtless," urged Passepartout, "we can pass, but perhaps it
would be more prudent -"
"What! Prudent!" cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed to
excite prodigiously. "At full speed, don't you see, at full
speed!"
"I know - I see," repeated Passepartout; "but it would be, if not
more prudent, since that word displeases you, at least more
natural -"
"Who! What! What's the matter with this fellow?" cried several.
The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself.
"Are you afraid?" asked Colonel Proctor.
"I afraid! Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman
can be as American as they!"
"All aboard!" cried the conductor.
"Yes, all aboard!" repeated Passepartout, and immediately. "But
they can't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural
for us to cross the bridge on foot, and let the train come
after!"
But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have
acknowledged its justice. The passengers resumed their places in
the cars. Passepartout took his seat without telling what had
passed. The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game.
The locomotive whistled vigorously. The engineer, reversing the
steam, backed the train for nearly a mile - retiring, like a
jumper, in order to take a longer leap. Then, with another
whistle, he began to move forward. The train increased its speed,
and soon its rapidity became frightful. A prolonged screech
issued from the locomotive. The piston worked up and down twenty
strokes to the second. They perceived that the whole train,
rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, hardly bore
upon the rails at all.
And they passed over! It was like a flash. No one saw the bridge.
The train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and
the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles
beyond the station. But scarcely had the train passed the river,
when the bridge, completely ruined, fell with a crash into the
rapids of Medicine Bow.
Chapter 29
In Which Certain Incidents Are Narrated Which
Are Only to Be Met with on American Railroads
The train pursued its course, that evening, without interruption,
passing Fort Saunders, crossing Cheyne Pass, and reaching Evans
Pass. The road here attained the highest elevation of the
journey, eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of
the sea. The travelers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by
limitless plains, leveled by nature. A branch of the "grand
trunk" led off southward to Denver, the capital of Colorado. The
country round about is rich in gold and silver, and more than
fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there.
Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from
San Francisco, in three days and three nights. Four days and
nights more would probably bring them to New York. Phileas Fogg
was not as yet behind time.
During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left. Lodge Pole
Creek ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between
the territories of Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska at
eleven, passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the
southern branch of the Platte River.
It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on
the 23rd of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge.
Two powerful locomotives, carrying nine ears of invited guests,
amongst whom was Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road,
stopped at this point. Cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees
performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, and
the first number of the Rail-way Pioneer was printed by a press
brought on the train. Thus was celebrated the inauguration of
this great railroad, a mighty instrument of progress and
civilization, thrown across the desert, and destined to link
together cities and towns which do not yet exist. The whistle of
the locomotive, more powerful than Amphion's lyre, was about to
bid them rise from American soil.
Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three
hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be covered before
reaching Omaha. The road followed the capricious windings of the
southern branch of the Platte River, on its left bank. At nine
the train stopped at the important town of North Platte, built
between the two arms of the river, which rejoin each other
around it and form a single artery - a large tributary whose
waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha.
The one hundred and first meridian was passed.
Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one - not
even the dummy -complained of the length of the trip. Fix had
begun by winning several guineas, which he seemed likely to lose;
but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr.
Fogg. During the morning, chance distinctly favored that
gentleman. Trumps and honors were showered upon his hands.
Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of
playing a spade, when a voice behind him said, "I should play a
diamond."
Mr. Fogg, Aouda and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel
Proctor.
Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognized each other at once.
"Ah! It's you, is it, Englishman?" cried the colonel. "It's you
who are going to play a spade!"
"And who plays it," replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down
the ten of spades.
"Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds," replied Colonel
Proctor, in an insolent tone.
He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been
played, adding, "You don't understand anything about whist."
"Perhaps I do, as well as another," said Phileas Fogg, rising.
"You have only to try, son of John Bull," replied the colonel.
Aouda turned pale, and her blood ran cold. She seized Mr. Fogg's
arm and gently pulled him back. Passepartout was ready to pounce
upon the American, who was staring insolently at his opponent.
But Fix got up, and, going to Colonel Proctor said, "You forget
that it is I with whom you have to deal, sir; for it was I whom
you not only insulted, but struck!"
"Mr. Fix," said Mr. Fogg, "pardon me, but this affair is mine,
and mine only. The colonel has again insulted me, by insisting
that I should not play a spade, and he shall give me satisfaction
for it."
"When and where you will," replied the American, "and with
whatever weapon you choose."
Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg. As vainly did the
detective endeavor to make the quarrel his. Passepartout wished
to throw the colonel out of the window, but a sign from his
master cheeked him. Phileas Fogg left the car, and the American
followed him upon the platform. "Sir," said Mr. Fogg to his
adversary, "I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe, and any
delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage."
"Well, what's that to me?" replied Colonel Proctor.
"Sir," said Mr. Fogg, very politely, "after our meeting at San
Francisco, I determined to return to America and find you as soon
as I had completed the business which called me to England."
"Really!"
"Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?"
"Why not ten years hence?"
"I say six months," returned Phileas Fogg, "and I shall be at the
place of meeting promptly."
"All this is an evasion," cried Stamp Proctor. "Now or never!"
"Very good. You are going to New York?"
"No."
"To Chicago?"
"No."
"To Omaha?"
"What difference is it to you? Do you know Plum Creek?"
"No," replied Mr. Fogg.
"It's the next station. The train will be there in an hour, and
will stop there ten minutes. In ten minutes several revolver
shots could be exchanged."
"Very well," said Mr. Fogg. "I will stop at Plum Creek."
"And I guess you'll stay there too," added the American
insolently.
"Who knows?" replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as
usual. He began to reassure Aouda, telling her that blusterers
were never to be feared, and begged Fix to be his second at the
approaching duel, a request which the detective could not refuse.
Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness.
At eleven o'clock the locomotive's whistle announced that they
were approaching Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed
by Fix, went out upon the platform. Passepartout accompanied him,
carrying a pair of revolvers. Aouda remained in the car, as pale
as death.
The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on
the platform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his
second. But just as the combatants were about to step from the
train, the conductor hurried up, and shouted, "You can't get off,
gentlemen!"
"Why not?" asked the colonel.
"We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop."
"But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman."
"I am sorry," said the conductor; "but we shall be off at once.
There's the bell ringing now."
The train started.
"I'm really very sorry, -" said the conductor. "Under any other
circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you. But, after
all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we
go along?"
"That wouldn't be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman," said
the colonel, in a jeering tone.
"It would be perfectly so," replied Phileas Fogg.
"Well, we are really in America," thought Passepartout, "and the
conductor is a gentleman of the first order!"
So muttering, he followed his master.
The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed
through the cars to the rear of the train. The last car was only
occupied by a dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked
if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few
moments, as two gentlemen had an affair of honor to settle. The
passengers granted the request with alacrity, and straightway
disappeared on the platform.
The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for
their purpose. The adversaries might march on each other in the
aisle, and fire at their ease. Never was duel more easily
arranged. Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor, each provided with two
six-barreled revolvers, entered the car. The seconds, remaining
outside, shut them in. They were to begin firing at the first
whistle of the locomotive. After an interval of two minutes, what
remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car.
Nothing could be more simple. Indeed, it was all so simple that
Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would
crack. They were listening for the whistle agreed upon, when
suddenly savage cries resounded in the air, accompanied by
reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the
duelists were. The reports continued in front and the whole
length of the train. Cries of terror proceeded from the interior
of the cars.
Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted
their prison, and rushed forward where the noise was most
clamorous. They then perceived that the train was attacked by a
band of Sioux.
This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for more
than once they had waylaid trains on the road. A hundred of them
had, according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without
stopping the train, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at
full gallop.
The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to
which the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by
revolver shots.
The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the
engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets. A Sioux chief,
wishing to stop the train, but not knowing how to work the
regulator, had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve,
and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity.
The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like
enraged monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and
fighting hand to hand with the passengers. Penetrating the
baggage-car, they pillaged it, throwing the trunks out of the
train. The cries and shots were constant. The travelers defended
themselves bravely. Some of the cars were barricaded, and
sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried along at a speed of
a hundred miles an hour.
Aouda behaved courageously from the first. She defended herself
like a true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the
broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance. Twenty
Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels
crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms.
Several passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats.
It was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted
for ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the
Sioux if the train was not stopped. Fort Kearney station, where
there was a garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once
passed, the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort
Kearney and the station beyond.
The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and
fell. At the same moment he cried, "Unless the train is stopped
in five minutes, we are lost!"
"It shall be stopped," said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from
the car.
"Stay, monsieur," cried Passepartout. "I will go."
Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a
door unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the
car; and while the struggle continued, and the balls whizzed
across each other over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic
experience, and with amazing agility worked his way under the
cars, holding on to the chains, aiding himself by the brakes and
edges of the sashes, creeping from one car to another with
marvelous skill, and thus gaining the forward end of the train.
There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the
tender, with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing
to the traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the
yoking-bar, had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out. The
train, now detached from the engine, remained a little behind,
whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed.
Carried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved
for several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they
stopped, less than a hundred feet from Kearney station.
The soldiers of the fort, attracted by the shots, hurried up. The
Sioux had not expected them, and decamped in a body before the
train entirely stopped.
But when the passengers counted each other on the station
platform several were found missing; among others the courageous
Frenchman, whose devotion had just saved them.
Chapter 30
In Which Phileas Fogg Simply Does His Duty
Three passengers - including Passepartout - had disappeared. Had
they been killed in the struggle? Were they taken prisoners by
the Sioux? It was impossible to tell.
There were many wounded, but none mortally. Colonel Proctor was
one of the most seriously hurt. He had fought bravely, and a ball
had entered his groin. He was carried into the station with the
other wounded passengers, to receive such attention as could be
of help.
Aouda was safe. Phileas Fogg, who had been in the thickest of the
fight, had not received a scratch. Fix was slightly wounded in
the arm. But Passepartout was not to be found, and tears coursed
down Aouda's cheeks.
All the passengers had gotten out of the train, the wheels of
which were stained with blood. From the tires and spokes hung
ragged pieces of flesh. As far as the eye could reach on the
white plain behind, red trails were visible. The last Sioux were
disappearing in the south, along the banks of Republican River.
Mr. Fogg, with folded arms, remained motionless. He had a serious
decision to make. Aouda, standing near him, looked at him without
speaking, and he understood her look. If his servant was a
prisoner, ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the
Indians? "I will find him, living or dead," he said quietly to
Aouda.
"Ah, Mr. - Mr. Fogg!" cried she, clasping his hands and covering
them with tears.
"Living," added Mr. Fogg, "if we do not lose a moment."
Phileas Fogg, by this resolution, inevitably sacrificed himself.
He pronounced his own doom. The delay of a single day would make
him lose the steamer at New York, and his bet would be certainly
lost. But as he thought, "It is my duty," he did not hesitate.
The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there. A hundred of
his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the
station, should the Sioux attack it.
"Sir," said Mr. Fogg to the captain, "three passengers have
disappeared."
"Dead?" asked the captain.
"Dead or prisoners. That is the uncertainty which must be solved.
Do you propose to pursue the Sioux?"
"That's a serious thing to do, sir," returned the captain. "These
Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas, and I cannot leave the
fort unprotected."
"The lives of three men are in question, sir," said Phileas
Fogg.
"Doubtless, but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save
three?"
"I don't know whether you can, sir, but you ought to do so.
"Nobody here," returned the other, "has a right to teach me my
duty."
"Very well," said Mr. Fogg, coldly. "I will go alone."
"You, sir!" cried Fix, coming up. "You go alone in pursuit of the
Indians?"
"Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish - him to whom
everyone present owes his life? I shall go."
"No, sir, you shall not go alone," cried the captain, touched in
spite of himself. "No! You are a brave man. Thirty volunteers!"
he added, turning to the soldiers.
The whole company started forward at once. The captain had only
to pick his men. Thirty were chosen, and an old sergeant placed
at their head.
"Thanks, captain," said Mr. Fogg.
"Will you let me go with you?" asked Fix.
"Do as you please, sir. But if you wish to do me a favor, you
will remain with Aouda. In case anything should happen to me -"
A sudden pallor overspread the detective's face. Separate himself
from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step!
Leave him to wander about in this desert! Fix gazed attentively
at Mr. Fogg, and, despite his suspicions and of the struggle
which was going on within him, he lowered his eyes before that
calm and frank look.
"I will stay," he said.
A few moments later, Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman's hand,
and, having confided to her his precious carpetbag, went off with
the sergeant and his little squad. But, before going, he had said
to the soldiers, "My friends, I will divide five thousand dollars
among you, if we save the prisoners."
It was then a little past noon.
Aouda retired to a waiting-room, and there she waited alone,
thinking of the simple and noble generosity, the tranquil
courage of Phileas Fogg. He had sacrificed his fortune, and was
now risking his life, all without hesitation, from duty, in
silence.
Fix did not have the same thoughts, and could scarcely conceal
his agitation. He walked feverishly up and down the platform, but
soon resumed his outward composure. He now saw the folly of which
he had been guilty in letting Fogg go alone. What! This man, whom
he had just followed around the world, was permitted now to
separate himself from him! He began to accuse and abuse himself,
and, as if he were director of police, administered to himself a
sound lecture for his greenness.
"I have been an idiot!" he thought, "and this man will see it. He
has gone, and won't come back! But how is it that I, who have in
my pocket a warrant for his arrest, have been so fascinated by
him? Decidedly, I am nothing but an ass!"
So reasoned the detective, while the hours crept by all too
slowly. He did not know what to do. Sometimes he was tempted to
tell Aouda all, but he could not doubt how the young woman would
receive his confidences. What course should he take? He thought
of pursuing Fogg across the vast white plains. It did not seem
impossible that he might overtake him. Footsteps were easily
printed on the snow! But soon, under a new sheet, every imprint
would be effaced.
Fix became discouraged. He felt a sort of insurmountable longing
to abandon the game altogether. He could now leave Fort Kearney
station, and pursue his journey homeward in peace.
Towards two o'clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing hard,
long whistles were heard approaching from the east. A great
shadow, preceded by a wild light, slowly advanced, appearing
still larger through the mist, which gave it a fantastic aspect.
No train was expected from the east, neither had there been time
for the help asked for by telegraph to arrive. The train from
Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day. The mystery
was soon explained.
The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening
whistles, was that which, having been detached from the train,
had continued its route with such terrific rapidity, carrying off
the unconscious engineer and stoker. It had run several miles,
when, the fire becoming low for want of fuel, the steam had
slackened. It had finally stopped an hour after, some twenty
miles beyond Fort Kearney. Neither the engineer nor the stoker
was dead. After remaining for some time in their swoon, they had
come to themselves. The train had then stopped. The engineer,
when he found himself in the desert, and the locomotive without
cars, understood what had happened. He could not imagine how the
locomotive had become separated from the train, but he did not
doubt that the train left behind was in distress.
He did not hesitate what to do. It would be prudent to continue
on to Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train,
which the Indians might still be engaged in pillaging.
Nevertheless, he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace; the
pressure again mounted, and the locomotive returned, running
backwards to Fort Kearney. This it was which was whistling in the
mist.
The travelers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at
the head of the train. They could now continue the journey so
terribly interrupted.
Aouda, on seeing the locomotive come up, hurried out of the
station, and asked the conductor, "Are you going to start?"
"At once, madam."
"But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travelers -"
"I cannot interrupt the trip," replied the conductor. "We are
already three hours behind time."
"And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?"
"Tomorrow evening, madam."
"Tomorrow evening! But then it will be too late! We must wait -"
"It is impossible," responded the conductor. "If you wish to go,
please get in."
"I will not go," said Aouda.
Fix had heard this conversation. A little while before, when
there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey, he had made
up his mind to leave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was
there, ready to start, and he had only to take his seat in the
car, an irresistible influence held him back. The station
platform burned his feet, and he could not stir. The conflict in
his mind again began; anger and failure stifled him. He wished to
struggle on to the end.
Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded, among them
Colonel Proctor, whose injuries were serious, had taken their
places in the train. The buzzing of the overheated boiler was
heard, and the steam was escaping from the valves. The engineer
whistled, the train started, and soon disappeared, mingling its
white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow.
The detective had remained behind.
Several hours passed. The weather was dismal, and it was very
cold. Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station. He might
have been thought asleep. Aouda, despite the storm, kept coming
out of the waiting-room, going to the end of the platform, and
peering through the tempest of snow, as if to pierce the mist
which narrowed the horizon around her, and to hear, if possible,
some welcome sound. She heard and saw nothing. Then she would
return, chilled through, to issue out again after the lapse of a
few moments, but always in vain.
Evening came, and the little band had not returned. Where could
they be? Had they found the Indians, and were they having a
conflict with them, or were they still wandering amid the mist?
The commander of the fort was anxious, though he tried to conceal
his apprehensions. As night approached, the snow fell less
plentifully, but it became intensely cold. Absolute silence
rested on the plains. Neither flight of bird nor passing of beast
troubled the perfect calm.
Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart
stifled with anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains.
Her imagination carried her far off, and showed her innumerable
dangers. What she suffered through the long hours it would be
impossible to describe.
Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep.
Once a man approached and spoke to him, and the detective merely
replied by shaking his head.
Thus the night passed. At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the
sun rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to
recognize objects two miles off. Phileas Fogg and the squad had
gone southward. In the south there was not a sign of them. It was
then seven o'clock.
The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to
take.
Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?
Should he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those
already sacrificed? His hesitation did not last long, however.
Calling one of his lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering a
reconnaissance, when gunshots were heard. Was it a signal? The
soldiers rushed out of the fort, and half a mile off they
perceived a little band returning in good order.
Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him were
Passepartout and the other two travelers, rescued from the
Sioux.
They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort
Kearney. Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and
his companions had begun to struggle with their captors, three of
whom the Frenchman had felled with his fists, when his master and
the soldiers hastened up to their relief.
All were welcomed with joyful cries. Phileas Fogg distributed the
reward he had promised to the soldiers, while Passepartout, not
without reason, muttered to himself, "It must certainly be
confessed that I cost my master dear!"
Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have
been difficult to analyze the thoughts which struggled within
him. As for Aouda, she took her protector's hand and pressed it
in her own, too much moved to speak.
Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train. He
thought he should find it there, ready to start for Omaha, and
he hoped that the time lost might be regained.
"The train! The train!" cried he.
"Gone," replied Fix.
"And when does the next train pass here?" said Phileas Fogg.
"Not till this evening."
"Ah!" returned the impassible gentleman quietly.
Chapter 31
Fix the Detective Considerably Furthers
the Interests of Phileas Fogg
Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time.
Passepartout, the involuntary cause of this delay, was desperate.
He had ruined his master!
At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking
him intently in the face, said: "Seriously, sir, are you in great
haste?"
"Quite seriously."
"I have a purpose in asking," resumed Fix. "Is it absolutely
necessary that you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine
o'clock in the evening, the time that the steamer leaves for
Liverpool?"
"It is absolutely necessary."
"And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians,
you would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?"
"Yes, with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left."
"Good! You are therefore twenty hours behind. Twelve from twenty
leaves eight. You must regain eight hours. Do you wish to try to
do so?"
"On foot?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"No; on a sledge," replied Fix. "On a sledge with sails. A man
has proposed such a method to me."
It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose
offer he had refused.
Phileas Fogg did not reply at once, but Fix, having pointed out
the man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr.
Fogg went up to him. An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American,
whose name was Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.
There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two
long beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a
sledge, and upon which there was room for five or six persons. A
high mast was fixed on the frame, held firmly by metallic
lashings, to which was attached a large brigantine sail. This
mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail. Behind, a
sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle. It was, in short, a
sledge rigged like a sloop. During the winter, when the trains
are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely rapid
journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another.
Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind
them, they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed
equal if not superior to that of the express trains.
Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this
land-craft. The wind was favorable, being fresh, and blowing from
the west. The snow had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of
being able to transport Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha. Thence
the trains eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York. It
was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered, and
such an opportunity was not to be rejected.
Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of traveling in
the open air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at
Fort Kearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to
Europe by a better route and under more favorable conditions. But
Aouda refused to separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was
delighted with her decision, for nothing could induce him to
leave his master while Fix was with him.
It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts. Was this
conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still
regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey
round the world completed, would think himself absolutely safe in
England? Perhaps Fix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat
modified, but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to
hasten the return of the whole party to England as much as
possible.
At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start. The passengers
took their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in
their traveling-cloaks. The two great sails were hoisted, and
under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened
snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour.
The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is
at most two hundred miles. If the wind held good, the distance
might be covered in five hours. If no accident happened the
sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock.
What a journey! The travelers, huddled close together, could not
speak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they
were going. The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the
waves. When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed
to be lifted off the ground by its sails. Mudge, who was at the
rudder, kept in a straight line, and by a turn of his hand
checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make. All
the sails were up, and the jib was so arranged as not to screen
the brigantine. A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib, held out
to the wind, added its force to the other sails. Although the
speed could not be exactly estimated, the sledge could not be
going at less than forty miles an hour.
"If nothing breaks," said Mudge, "we shall get there!"
Mr. Fogg had made it Mudge's interest to reach Omaha within the
time agreed on by the offer of a handsome reward.
The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight
line, was as flat as a sea. It seemed like a vast frozen lake.
The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the
southwest to the northwest by Great Island, Columbus, an
important Nebraska town, Schuyler and Fremont, to Omaha. It
followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River. The
sledge, shortening this route, took a chord of the arc described
by the railway. Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the
Platte River, because it was frozen. The road, then, was quite
clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear -
an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.
But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend
the mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly.
These lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument,
resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow. The sledge slid along
in the midst of a plaintively intense melody.
"Those chords give the fifth and the octave," said Mr. Fog.
These were the only words he uttered during the journey. Aouda,
cosily packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as
possible from the attacks of the freezing wind. As for
Passepartout, his face was as red as the sun's disc when it sets
in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled the biting air. With his
natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope again. They would
reach New York on the evening, if not on the morning, of the
11th, and there was still some chance that it would be before the
steamer sailed for Liverpool.
Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by
the hand. He remembered that it was the detective who procured
the sledge, the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but,
checked by some presentiment he kept his usual reserve. One
thing, however, Passepartout would never forget, and that was the
sacrifice which Mr. Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue
him from the Sioux. Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life.
No! His servant would never forget that!
While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so
different, the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow. The
creeks it passed over were not perceived. Fields and steams
disappeared under the uniform whiteness. The plain was absolutely
deserted. Between the Union Pacific road and the branch, which
unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited
island. Neither village, station, nor fort appeared. From time to
time they sped by some phantom-like tree, whose white skeleton
twisted and rattled in the wind. Sometimes flocks of wild birds
rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves ran
howling after the sledge. Passepartout, revolver in hand, held
himself ready to fire on those which came too near. Had an
accident then happened b the sledge, the travelers, attacked by
these beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger. But
the sledge held on its even course, soon gained on the wolves,
and before long left the howling band at a safe distance behind.
About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was
crossing the Platte River. He said nothing, but he felt certain
that he was now within twenty miles of Omaha. In less than an
hour he left the rudder and furled his sails, while the sledge,
carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it, went
on half a mile further with its sails unspread.
It stopped at last, and Mudge, pointing to a mass of roofs white
with snow, said: "We are there!"
Arrived! Arrived at the station which is in daily communication,
by numerous trains, with the Atlantic seaboard!
Passepartout and Fix jumped off, stretched their stiffened limbs,
and aided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the
sledge. Phileas Fogg generously rewarded Mudge, whose hand
Passepartout warmly grasped and the party directed their steps to
the Omaha railway station.
The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important
Nebraska town. Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and
Rock Island Railroad, which runs directly east, and passes fifty
stations.
A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached
the station, and they only had time to get into the cars. They
had seen nothing of Omaha, but Passepartout confessed to himself
that this was not to be regretted, as they were not traveling to
see the sights.
The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa by Council
Bluffs, Des Moines and Iowa City. During the night it crossed the
Mississippi at Davenport, and by Rock Island entered Illinois.
The next day, which was the 10th, at four o'clock in the evening,
it reached Chicago, already risen from its ruins, and more
proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful Lake
Michigan.
Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York, but trains
run frequently from Chicago. Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to
the other, and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and
Chicago Railway left at full speed, as if it fully comprehended
that that gentleman had no time to lose. It raced over Indiana,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey like a flash, rushing through
towns with antique names, some of which had streets and
car-tracks, but as yet no houses. At last the Hudson came into
view, and, at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th,
the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river,
before the very pier of the Cunard line.
The China, for Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an hour
before!
Chapter 32
In Which Phileas Fogg Engages in a
Direct Struggle with Bad Fortune
The China, in leaving, seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg's
last hope. None of the other steamers were able to serve his
projects. The Pereire, of the French Transatlantic Company, whose
admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort, did not
leave until the 14th. The Hamburg boats did not go directly to
Liverpool or London, but to Havre; and the additional trip from
Havre to Southampton would render Phileas Fogg's last efforts of
no avail. The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day, and
could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager.
Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw, which gave
him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers.
Passepartout was crushed. It overwhelmed him to lose the boat by
three-quarters of an hour. It was his fault, for, instead of
helping his master, he had not ceased putting obstacles in his
path! And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour, when he
counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account,
when he thought that the immense stake, added to the heavy
charges of this useless journey, would completely ruin Mr. Fogg,
he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations. Mr. Fogg,
however, did not reproach him; and, on leaving the Cunard pier,
only said: "We will consult about what is best tomorrow. Come."
The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat, and
drove in a carriage to the St. Nicholas Hotel on Broadway. Rooms
were engaged and the night passed, briefly to Phileas Fogg, who
slept profoundly, but very long to Aouda and the others, whose
agitation did not permit them to rest.
The next day was the 12th of December. From seven in the morning
of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st
there were nine days, thirteen hours, and forty-five minutes. If
Phileas Fogg had left in the China, one of the fastest steamers
on the Atlantic, he would have reached Liverpool, and then
London, within the period agreed upon.
Mr. Fogg left the hotel alone, after giving Passepartout
instructions to await his return, and inform Aouda to be ready at
an instant's notice. He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson, and
looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river,
for any that were about to depart. Several had departure signals,
and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide; for in this
immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that
vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe. But they
were mostly sailing vessels, of which, of course, Phileas Fogg
could make no use.
He seemed about to give up all hope, when he sighted, anchored at
the Battery, a cable's length off at most, a trading vessel, with
a well-shaped screw, whose funnel, puffing a cloud of smoke,
indicated that she was getting ready for departure.
Phileas Fogg hailed a boat, got into it, and soon found himself
on board the Henrietta, iron-hulled, wood-built above. He
ascended to the deck, and asked for the captain, who presented
himself. He was a man of fifty, a sort of sea-wolf, with big
eyes, a complexion of oxidized copper, red hair and thick neck,
and a growling voice.
"The captain?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"I am the captain."
"I am Phileas Fogg of London."
"And I am Andrew Speedy of Cardiff."
"You are going to put to sea?"
"In an hour."
"You are bound for -"
"Bordeaux."
"And your cargo?"
"No freight. Going in ballast."
"Have you any passengers?"
"No passengers. Never have passengers. Too much in the way."
"Is your vessel a swift one?"
"Between eleven and twelve knots. The Henrietta is well known."
"Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool?"
"To Liverpool? Why not to China?"
"I said Liverpool."
"No!"
"No?"
"No. I am setting out for Bordeaux, and shall go to Bordeaux."
"Money is no object?"
"None."
The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply. "But
the owners of the Henrietta -" resumed Phileas Fogg.
"The owners are myself," replied the captain. "The vessel belongs
to me."
"I will freight it for you."
"No."
"I will buy it of you."
"No."
Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment, but the
situation was a grave one. It was not at New York as at Hong
Kong, nor with the captain of the Henrietta as with the captain
of the Tankadere. Up to this time money had smoothed away every
obstacle. Now money failed.
Still, some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat,
unless by balloon - which would have been venturesome, besides
not being capable of being put in practice. It seemed that
Phileas Fogg had an idea for he said to the captain, "Well, will
you carry me to Bordeaux?"
"No, not if you paid me two hundred dollars."
"I offer you two thousand."
"Apiece?"
"Apiece."
"And there are four of you?"
"Four."
Captain Speedy began to scratch his head. There was eight
thousand dollars to gain, without changing his route, for which
it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds
of passengers. Besides, passengers at two thousand dollars are no
longer passengers, but valuable merchandise. "I start at nine
o'clock," said Captain Speedy, simply. "Are you and your party
ready?"
"We will be on board at nine o'clock," replied Mr. Fogg.
It was half-past eight. To disembark from the Henrietta, jump
into a hack, hurry to the St. Nicholas, and return with Aouda,
Passepartout and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief
time, and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never
abandoned him. They were on board when the Henrietta made ready
to weigh anchor.
When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost,
he uttered a prolonged "Oh!" which extended throughout his vocal
gamut.
As for Fix, he said to himself that the Bank of England would
certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified. When they
reached England, even if Mr. Fogg did not throw some handfuls of
bank-bills into the sea, more than seven thousand pounds would
have been spent!
Chapter 33
In Which Phileas Fogg Shows Himself Equal to the Occasion
An hour later, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks
the entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and
put to sea. During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire
Island, and directed her course rapidly eastward.
At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the
vessel's position. It might be thought that this was Captain
Speedy. Not the least in the world. It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.
As for Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and
key, and was uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at
once pardonable and excessive.
What had happened was very simple. Phileas Fogg wished to go to
Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there. Then
Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the
thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with
his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an
occasional crew, and were not on the best terms with the
captain, went over to him in a body. This was why Phileas Fogg
was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a
prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta was
directing her course towards Liverpool. It was very clear, to see
Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.
How the adventure ended will be seen soon. Aouda was anxious,
though she said nothing. As for Passepartout, he thought Mr.
Fogg's maneuver simply glorious. The captain had said "between
eleven and twelve knots," and the Henrietta confirmed his
prediction.
If, then - for there were "ifs" still - the sea did not become
too violent, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no
accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta
might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool
in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December. It
is true that, once arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta,
added to that of the Bank of England, might create more
difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire.
During the first days, they went along smoothly enough. The sea
was not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the
northeast, the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed
across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer.
Passepartout was delighted. His master's last exploit, the
consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the
crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow. He formed warm
friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic
feats. He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and
that the stokers fired up like heroes. His loquacious good-humor
infected everyone. He had forgotten the past, its vexations and
delays. He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished.
Sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the
furnaces of the Henrietta. Often, also, the worthy fellow
revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye,
but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer
existed.
Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going
on. The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg
managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.
He did not know what to think. For, after all, a man who began by
stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a
vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the
Henrietta, under Fogg's command, was not going to Liverpool at
all, but to some part of the world where the robber, turned into
a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety. The conjecture was
at least a plausible one, and the detective began to seriously
regret that he had embarked on the affair.
As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his
cabin. Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals,
courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions. Mr. Fogg did
not seem even to know that there was a captain on board.
On the 13th they passed the edge of the banks of Newfoundland, a
dangerous locality. During the winter, especially, there are
frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind. Ever since the evening
before, the barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an
approaching change in the atmosphere. During the night the
temperature varied, the cold became sharper, and the wind veered
to the southeast.
This was a misfortune. Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his
course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam;
but the vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea,
the long waves of which broke against the stern. She pitched
violently, and this retarded her progress. The breeze little by
little swelled into a tempest, and it was to be feared that the
Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the
waves.
Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days
the poor fellow experienced constant fright. But Phileas Fogg was
a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea.
He kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam. The
Henrietta, when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them,
swamping her deck, but passing safely. Sometimes the screw rose
out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of
water raised the stern above the waves, but the craft always kept
straight ahead.
The wind, however, did not grow as violent as might have been
feared. It was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on
with a speed of ninety miles an hour. It continued fresh, but,
unhappily, it remained obstinately in the southeast, rendering
the sails useless.
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas
Fogg's departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been
seriously delayed. Half of the voyage was almost accomplished,
and the worst localities had been passed. In summer, success
would have been well-nigh certain. In winter, they were at the
mercy of the bad season. Passepartout said nothing; but he
cherished hope in secret, and comforted himself with the
reflection that, if the wind failed them, they might still count
on the steam.
On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and
began to speak earnestly with him. Without knowing why - it was a
presentiment, perhaps -Passepartout became vaguely uneasy. He
would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the
engineer was saying. He finally managed to catch a few words, and
was sure he heard his master say, "You are certain of what you
tell me?"
"Certain, sir," replied the engineer. "You must remember that,
since we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces.
Though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to
Bordeaux, we haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to
Liverpool."
"I will consider," replied Mr. Fogg.
Passepartout understood it all. He was seized with mortal
anxiety. The coal was giving out! "Ah, if my master can get over
that," he muttered, "he'll be a famous man!" He could not help
imparting to Fix what he had overheard.
"Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?"
"Of course."
"Ass!" replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning
on his heel.
Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the
epithet, the reason of which he could not for the life of him
comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was
probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his
self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a false scent
around the world, and he said nothing.
And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt? It was difficult to
imagine. Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for
that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, "Feed all
the fires until the coal is exhausted."
A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth
torrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam
on; but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced
that the coal would give out in the course of the day.
"Do not let the fires go down," replied Mr. Fogg. "Keep them up
to the last. Let the valves be filled."
Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position,
called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy. It
was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a
tiger. He went to the poop, saying to himself, "He will be like a
madman!"
In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the
poop-deck. The bomb was Captain Speedy. It was clear that he was
on the point of bursting. "Where are we?" were the first words
his anger permitted him to utter. Had the poor man been
apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of
wrath.
"Where are we?" he repeated, with purple face.
"Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool," replied Mr. Fogg,
with imperturbable calmness.
"Pirate!" cried Captain Speedy.
"I have sent for you, sir -"
"Pickaroon!"
"- sir," continued Mr. Fogg, "to ask you to sell me your vessel."
"No! By all the devils, no!"
"But I shall be obliged to burn her."
"Burn the Henrietta!"
"Yes, at least the upper part of her. The coal has given
out."
"Burn my vessel!" cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely
pronounce the words. "A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!"
"Here are sixty thousand," replied Phileas Fogg, handing the
captain a roll of bank bills. This had a prodigious effect on
Andrew Speedy. An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the
sight of sixty thousand dollars. The captain forgot in an instant
his anger, his imprisonment, and all his grudges against his
passenger. The Henrietta was twenty years old. It was a great
bargain. The bomb would not go off after all. Mr. Fogg had taken
away the match.
"And I shall still have the iron hull," said the captain in a
softer tone.
"The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?"
"Agreed."
And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and
consigned them to his pocket.
During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and
Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit. Nearly
twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull
and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the
craft! It was true, however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had
been stolen from the Bank.
When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him,
"Don't let this astonish you, sir. You must know that I shall
lose twenty thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a
quarter before nine of the evening of the 21st of December. I
missed the steamer at New York, and as you refused to take me to
Liverpool -"
"And I did well," cried Andrew Speedy; "for I have gained at
least forty thousand dollars by it!" He added, more sedately, "Do
you know one thing, Captain -"
"Fogg."
"Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you."
And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high
compliment, he was going away, when Mr. Fogg said, "The vessel
now belongs to me?"
"Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the masts - all the
wood, that is."
"Very well. Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled
down, and burn them."
It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the
adequate pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks and
the spare deck were sacrificed. On the next day, the 19th of
December, the masts, rafts and spars were burned. The crew worked
lustily, keeping up the fires. Passepartout hewed, cut and sawed
away with all his might. There was a perfect rage for
demolition.
The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck and top
sides disappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a
flat hulk. But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and
Fastnet Light. By ten in the evening they were passing
Queenstown. Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which
to get to London. That length of time was necessary to reach
Liverpool, with all steam on. And the steam was about to give out
altogether!
"Sir," said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr.
Fogg's project, "I really pity you. Everything is against you. We
are only opposite Queenstown."
"Ah," said Mr. Fogg, "is that place where we see the lights
Queenstown?"
"Yes."
"Can we enter the harbor?"
"Not under three hours. Only at high tide."
"Wait," replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his
features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt
once more to conquer ill fortune.
Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers
stop to put off the mails. These mails are carried to Dublin by
express trains always held in readiness to start. From Dublin
they are sent on to Liverpool by the most rapid boats, and thus
gain twelve hours on the Atlantic steamers.
Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way.
Instead of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the
Henrietta, he would be there by noon, and would therefore have
time to reach London before a quarter before nine in the
evening.
The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbor at one o'clock in the
morning, it then being high tide. Phileas Fogg, after being
grasped heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy, left that
gentleman on the leveled hulk of his craft, which was still worth
half what he had sold it for.
The party went on shore at once. Fix was greatly tempted to
arrest Mr. Fogg on the spot; but he did not. Why? What struggle
was going on within him? Had he changed his mind about "his man"?
Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake? He did not,
however, abandon Mr. Fogg. They all got on the train, which was
just ready to start, at half-past one. At dawn of day they were
in Dublin; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which,
disdaining to rise upon the waves, invariably cut through them.
Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay, at twenty
minutes before twelve, the 21st of December. He was only six
hours distant from London.
But at this moment Fix came up, put his hand upon Mr. Fogg's
shoulder, and, showing his warrant, said, "You are really Phileas
Fogg?"
"I am."
"I arrest you in the Queen's name!"
Chapter 34
In Which Phileas Fogg at Last Reaches London
Phileas Fogg was in prison. He had been shut up in the Custom
House, and he was to be transferred to London the next day.
Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen
upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen. Aouda was
thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not
understand. Passepartout explained to her how it was that the
honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber. The young
woman's heart revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she
saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector,
she wept bitterly.
As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty,
whether Mr. Fogg was guilty or not.
The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of
this new misfortune! Had he not concealed Fix's errand from his
master? When Fix revealed his true character and purpose, why had
he not told Mr. Fogg? If the latter had been warned, he would no
doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence, and satisfied him of
his mistake. At least, Fix would not have continued his journey
at the expense and on the heels of his master, only to arrest him
the moment he set foot on English soil. Passepartout wept till he
was blind and felt like blowing his brains out.
Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of
the Custom House. Neither wished to leave the place. Both were
anxious to see Mr. Fogg again.
That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he
was about to attain his end. This arrest was fatal. Having
arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st
of December, he had till a quarter before nine that evening to
reach the Reform Club, that is, nine hours and a quarter. The
journey from Liverpool to London was six hours.
If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would
have found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm and without apparent
anger, upon a wooden bench. He was not, it is true, resigned, but
this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of
any emotion. Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages,
all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst
forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment? No one
could tell. There he sat, calmly waiting - for what? Did he still
cherish hope? Did he still believe, now that the door of this
prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?
However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon
the table, and observed its advancing hands. Not a word escaped
his lips, but his look was singularly set and stern. The
situation, in any event, was a terrible one, and might be thus
stated: if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined; if he was a
knave, he was caught.
Did escape occur to him? Did he examine to see if there were any
practicable outlet from his prison? Did he think of escaping from
it? Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room. But the
door was locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods. He
sat down again, and drew his journal from his pocket. On the line
where these words were written, "21st December, Saturday,
Liverpool," he added, "80th day, 11:40 A.M.," and waited.
The Custom House clock struck one. Mr. Fogg observed that his
watch was two hours too fast.
Two hours! Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express
train, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter
before nine P.M. His forehead slightly wrinkled.
At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise
outside, then a hasty opening of doors. Passepartout's voice was
audible, and immediately after that of Fix. Phileas Fogg's eyes
brightened for an instant.
The door swung open, and he saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, who
hurried towards him.
Fix was out of breath, and his hair was in disorder. He could not
speak. "Sir," he stammered, "sir - forgive me - a most -
unfortunate resemblance - robber arrested three days ago - you -
are free!"
Phileas Fogg was free! He walked to the detective, looked him
steadily in the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever
made in his life, or which he ever would make, drew back his
arms, and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down.
"Well hit!" cried Passepartout. "Parbleu! That's what you might
call a good application of English fists!"
Fix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word. He had
only received his deserts. Mr. Fogg, Aouda and Passepartout left
the Custom House without delay, got into a cab, and in a few
moments descended at the station.
Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave
for London. It was forty minutes past two. The express train had
left thirty-five minutes before.
Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train.
There were several rapid locomotives on hand, but the railway
arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until
three o'clock.
At that hour Phileas Fogg, having stimulated the engineer by the
offer of a generous reward, at last set out towards London with
Aouda and his faithful servant.
It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half.
This would have been easy on a clear road throughout. But there
were forced delays, and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at
the terminus, all the clocks in London were striking ten minutes
before nine.1
Having made the tour of the world, he was behind time by five
minutes. He had lost the wager!
1 A somewhat remarkable eccentricity on the part of the London
clocks? Translator.
Chapter 35
In Which Phileas Fogg Does Not Have to
Repeat His Orders to Passepartout Twice
The dwellers in Saville Row would have been surprised the next
day, if they had been told that Phileas Fogg had returned home.
His doors and windows were still closed. No appearance of change
was visible.
After leaving the station, Mr. Fogg gave Passepartout
instructions to purchase some provisions, and quietly went to his
home.
He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity. Ruined!
And by the blundering of the detective! After having steadily
traveled that long journey, overcome a hundred obstacles, braved
many dangers, and still found time to do some good on his way, to
fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have
foreseen, and against which he was unarmed; it was terrible! But
a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him.
There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds
deposited at Barings, and this amount he owed to his friends of
the Reform Club. So great had been the expense of his tour that,
even had he won, it would not have enriched him; and it is
probable that he had not sought to enrich himself, being a man
who rather laid wagers for honor's sake than for the stake
proposed. But this wager totally ruined him.
Mr. Fogg's course, however, was fully decided upon. He knew what
remained for him to do.
A room in the house in Saville Row was set apart for Aouda, who
was overwhelmed with grief at her protector's misfortune. From
the words which Mr. Fogg dropped, she saw that he was meditating
some serious project.
Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort
to the desperate expedient of suicide, Passepartout kept a narrow
watch upon his master, though he carefully concealed the
appearance of so doing.
First of all, the worthy fellow had gone up to his room, and had
extinguished the gas burner, which had been burning for eighty
days. He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company,
and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense,
which he had been doomed to bear.
The night passed. Mr. Fogg went to bed, but did he sleep? Aouda
did not once close her eyes. Passepartout watched all night, like
a faithful dog, at his master's door.
Mr. Fogg called him in the morning, and told him to get Aouda's
breakfast, and a cup of tea and a chop for himself. He desired
Aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner, as his time would
be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights. In the
evening he would ask permission to have a few moment's
conversation with the young lady.
Passepartout, having received his orders, had nothing to do but
obey them. He looked at his imperturbable master, and could
scarcely bring his mind to leave him. His heart was full, and his
conscience tortured by remorse; for he accused himself more
bitterly than ever of being the cause of the
irretrievable disaster. Yes! if he had warned Mr. Fogg, and had
betrayed Fix's projects to him, his master would certainly not
have given the detective passage to Liverpool, and then -
Passepartout could hold in no longer.
"My master! Mr. Fogg!" he cried. "Why do you not curse me? It was
my fault that -"
"I blame no one," returned Phileas Fogg, with perfect calmness.
"Go!"
Passepartout left the room, and went to find Aouda, to whom he
delivered his master's message.
"Madam," he added, "I can do nothing myself - nothing! I have no
influence over my master; but you, perhaps -"
"What influence could I have?" replied Aouda. "Mr. Fogg is
influenced by no one. Has he ever understood that my gratitude to
him is overflowing? Has he ever read my heart? My friend, he must
not be left alone an instant! You say he is going to speak with
me this evening?"
"Yes, madam, probably to arrange for your protection and comfort
in England."
"We shall see," replied Aouda, becoming suddenly pensive.
Throughout this day (Sunday) the house in Saville Row was as if
uninhabited, and Phileas Fogg, for the first time since he had
lived in that house, did not set out for his club when
Westminster clock struck half-past eleven.
Why should he present himself at the Reform? His friends no
longer expected him there. As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in
the saloon on the evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December,
at a quarter before nine), he had lost his wager. It was not even
necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty
thousand pounds; for his antagonists already had his check in
their hands, and they had only to fill it out and send it to the
Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit.
Mr. Fogg, therefore, had no reason for going out, and so he
remained at home. He shut himself up in his room, and busied
himself putting his affairs in order. Passepartout continually
ascended and descended the stairs. The hours were long for him.
He listened at his master's door, and looked through the keyhole,
as if he had a perfect right to do so, and as if he feared that
something terrible might happen at any moment. Sometimes he
thought of Fix, but no longer in anger. Fix, like all the world,
had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty in
tracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout - This thought
haunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.
Finding himself too wretched to remain alone, he knocked at
Aouda's door, went into her room, seated himself, without
speaking, in a corner, and looked ruefully at the young woman.
Aouda was still pensive.
About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if
Aouda would receive him, and in a few moments he found himself
alone with her.
Phileas Fogg took a chair, and sat down near the fireplace
opposite Aouda. No emotion was visible on his face. Fogg returned
was exactly the Fogg who had gone away. There was the same calm,
the same impassibility.
He sat several minutes without speaking, then, bending his eyes
on Aouda, "Madam," he said, "will you pardon me for bringing you
to England?"
"I, Mr. Fogg!" replied Aouda, checking the pulsations of her
heart.
"Please let me finish," returned Mr. Fogg. "When I decided to
bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you,
I was rich, and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at
your disposal. Then your existence would have been free and
happy. But now I am ruined."
"I know it, Mr. Fogg," replied Aouda; "and I ask you in my turn,
will you forgive me for having followed you, and - who knows? -
for having, perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your
ruin?"
"Madam, you could not remain in India, and your safety could only
be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your
persecutors could not take you."
"So, Mr. Fogg," resumed Aouda, "not content with rescuing me from
a terrible death, you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort
in a foreign land?"
"Yes, madam, but circumstances have been against me. Still, I beg
to place the little I have left at your service."
"But what will become of you, Mr. Fogg?"
"As for me, madam," replied the gentleman, coldly, "I have need
of nothing."
"But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?"
"As I am in the habit of doing."
"At least," said Aouda, "want should not overtake a man like you.
Your friends -"
"I have no friends, madam."
"Your relatives -"
"I have no longer any relatives."
"I pity you, then, Mr. Fogg, for solitude is a sad thing, with no
heart to which to confide your griefs. They say, though, that
misery itself, shared by two sympathetic souls, may be borne with
patience."
"They say so, madam."
"Mr. Fogg," said Aouda, rising and seizing his hand, "do you wish
at once a kinswoman and friend? Will you have me for your wife?"
Mr. Fogg, at this, rose in his turn. There was an unwonted light
in his eyes, and a slight trembling of his lips. Aouda looked
into his face. The sincerity, rectitude, firmness and sweetness
of this soft glance of a noble woman, who could dare all to save
him to whom she owed all, at first astonished, then penetrated
him. He shut his eyes for an instant, as if to avoid her look.
When he opened them again, "I love you!" he said, simply. "Yes,
by all that is holiest, I love you, and I am entirely yours!"
"Ah!" cried Aouda, pressing his hand to her heart.
Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately. Mr. Fogg
still held Aouda's hand in his own. Passepartout understood, and
his big, round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its
zenith.
Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend
Samuel Wilson, of Marylebone parish, that evening.
Passepartout smiled his most genial smile, and said, "Never too
late."
It was five minutes past eight.
"Will it be for tomorrow, Monday?"
"For tomorrow, Monday," said Mr. Fogg, turning to Aouda.
"Yes, for tomorrow, Monday," she replied.
Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him.
Chapter 36
In Which Phileas Fogg's Name Is Once More
at a Premium on the Market
It is time to relate what a change took place in English public
opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber, a certain
James Strand, had been arrested, on the 17th day of December, at
Edinburgh. Three days before, Phileas Fogg had been a criminal,
who was being desperately followed up by the police. Now he was
an honorable gentleman, mathematically pursuing his eccentric
journey round the world.
The papers resumed their discussion about the wager. All those
who had laid bets, for or against him, revived their interest. As
if by magic; the "Phileas Fogg bonds" again became negotiable,
and many new wagers were made. Phileas Fogg's name was once more
at a premium on 'Change.
His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a
state of feverish suspense. Would Phileas Fogg, whom they had
forgotten, reappear before their eyes! Where was he at this
moment? The 17th of December, the day of James Strand's arrest,
was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Fogg's departure, and no news
of him had been received. Was he dead? Had he abandoned the
effort, or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed
upon? And would he appear on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a
quarter before nine in the evening, on the threshold of the
Reform Club saloon?
The anxiety in which, for three days, London society existed,
cannot be described. Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for
news of Phileas Fogg. Messengers were despatched to the house in
Saville Row morning and evening. No news. The police were
ignorant what had become of the detective, Fix, who had so
unfortunately followed up a false scent. Bets increased,
nevertheless, in number and value. Phileas Fogg, like a
racehorse, was drawing near his last turning-point. The bonds
were quoted, no longer at a hundred below par, but at twenty, at
ten, and at five; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in
his favor.
A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighboring
streets on Saturday evening. It seemed like a multitude of
brokers permanently established around the Reform Club.
Circulation was impeded, and everywhere disputes, discussions and
financial transactions were going on. The police had great
difficulty in keeping back the crowd, and as the hour when
Phileas Fogg was due approached, the excitement rose to its
highest pitch.
The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon
of the club. John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, the bankers,
Andrew Stuart, the engineer, Gauthier Ralph, the director of the
Bank of England and Thomas Flanagan, the brewer, one and all
waited anxiously.
When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight, Andrew Stuart
got up, saying, "Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the time agreed
upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired."
"What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?" asked
Thomas Flanagan.
"At twenty-three minutes past seven," replied Gauthier Ralph.
"The next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve."
"Well, gentlemen," resumed Andrew Stuart, "if Phileas Fogg had
come in the 7:23 train, he would have got here by this time. We
can, therefore, regard the bet as won."
"Wait, don't let us be too hasty," replied Samuel Fallentin. "You
know that Mr. Fogg is very eccentric. His punctuality is well
known. He never arrives too soon, or too late; and I should not
be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minute."
"Why," said Andrew Stuart nervously, "if I should see him, I
should not believe it was he."
"The fact is," resumed Thomas Flanagan, "Mr. Fogg's project was
absurdly foolish. Whatever his punctuality, he could not prevent
the delays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two
or three days would be fatal to his tour."
"Observe, too," added John Sullivan, "that we have received no
intelligence from him, though there are telegraphic lines all
along his route."
"He has lost, gentlemen," said Andrew Stuart, "he has a hundred
times lost! You know, besides, that the China - the only steamer
he could have taken from New York to get here in time - arrived
yesterday. I have seen a list of the passengers, and the name of
Phileas Fogg is not among them. Even if we admit that fortune has
favored him, he can scarcely have reached America. I think he
will be at least twenty days behind-hand, and that Lord
Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand."
"It is clear," replied Gauthier Ralph; "and we have nothing to do
but to present Mr. Fogg's cheque at Barings tomorrow."
At this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty
minutes to nine.
"Five minutes more," said Andrew Stuart.
The five gentlemen looked at each other. Their anxiety was
becoming intense; but, not wishing to betray it, they readily
assented to Mr. Fallentin's proposal of a rubber.
"I wouldn't give up my four thousand of the bet," said Andrew
Stuart, as he took his seat, "for three thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine."
The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine.
The players took up their cards, but could not keep their eyes
off the clock. Certainly, however secure they felt, minutes had
never seemed so long to them!
"Seventeen minutes to nine," said Thomas Flanagan, as he cut the
cards which Ralph handed to him.
Then there was a moment of silence. The great saloon was
perfectly quiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard,
with now and then a shrill cry. The pendulum beat the seconds,
which each player eagerly counted, as he listened, with
mathematical regularity.
"Sixteen minutes to nine!" said John Sullivan, in a voice which
betrayed his emotion.
One minute more, and the wager would be won. Andrew Stuart and
his partners suspended their game. They left their cards, and
counted the seconds.
At the fortieth second, nothing. At the fiftieth, still nothing.
At the fifty-fifth, a loud cry was heard in the street, followed
by applause, hurrahs and some fierce growls.
The players rose from their seats.
At the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened. The
pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when Phileas Fogg
appeared, followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way
through the club doors. In his calm voice, Phileas Fogg said,
"Here I am, gentlemen!"
Chapter 37
In Which It Is Shown That Phileas Fogg Gained Nothing
by His Tour around the World Except Happiness
Yes, Phileas Fogg in person.
The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the
evening - about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the
travelers in London - Passepartout had been sent by his master to
engage the services of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain
marriage ceremony, which was to take place the next day.
Passepartout went on his errand enchanted. He soon reached the
clergyman's house, but found him not at home. Passepartout
waited a good twenty minutes, and when he left the reverend
gentleman, it was thirty-five minutes past eight. But in what a
state he was! With his hair in disorder, and without his hat, he
ran along the street as never man was seen to run before,
overturning passersby, rushing over the sidewalk like a
waterspout.
In three minutes he was in Saville Row again, and staggered back
into Mr. Fogg's room.
He could not speak.
"What is the matter?" asked Mr. Fogg.
"My master!" gasped Passepartout. "Marriage-impossible -"
"Impossible?"
"Impossible - for tomorrow."
"Why so?"
"Because tomorrow - is Sunday!"
"Monday," replied Mr. Fogg.
"No - today - is Saturday."
"Saturday? Impossible!"
"Yes, yes, yes, yes!" cried Passepartout. "You have made a
mistake of one day! We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time,
but there are only ten minutes left!"
Passepartout had seized his master by the collar, and was
dragging him along with irresistible force.
Phileas Fogg, thus kidnapped, without having time to think, left
his house, jumped into a cab, promised a hundred pounds to the
cabman, and, having run over two dogs and overturned five
carriages, reached the Reform Club.
The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the
great saloon.
Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in
eighty days!
Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds!
How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made
this error of a day? How came he to think that he had arrived in
London on Saturday, the twenty-first day of December, when it was
really Friday, the twentieth, the seventy-ninth day only from his
departure?
The cause of the error is very simple.
Phileas Fogg had, without suspecting it, gained one day on his
journey, and this merely because he had traveled constantly
eastward. He would, on the contrary, have lost a day had he gone
in the opposite direction, that is, westward.
In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days
therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he
crossed degrees in this direction. There are three hundred and
sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three
hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives
precisely twenty-four hours - that is, the day unconsciously
gained. In other words, while Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw
the sun pass the meridian eighty times, his friends in London
only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times. This is why
they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday, and not Sunday.
as Mr. Fogg thought.
And Passepartout's famous family watch, which had always kept
London time, would have betrayed this fact, if it had marked the
days as well as the hours and the minutes!
Phileas Fogg, then, had won the twenty thousand pounds; but, as
he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way, the pecuniary
gain was small. His object was, however, to be victorious, and
not to win money. He divided the one thousand pounds that
remained between Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix, against
whom he cherished no grudge. He deducted, however, from
Passepartout's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his
room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours, for the sake of
regularity.
That evening, Mr. Fogg, as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever, said
to Aouda: "Is our marriage still agreeable to you?"
"Mr. Fogg," replied she, "it is for me to ask that question. You
were ruined, but now you are rich again."
"Pardon me, madam. My fortune belongs to you. If you had not
suggested our marriage, my servant would not have gone to the
Reverend Samuel Wilson's, I should not have been informed of my
error, and -"
"Dear Mr. Fogg!" said the young woman.
"Dear Aouda!" replied Phileas Fogg.
It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight
hours after, and that Passepartout, glowing and dazzling, gave
the bride away. Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to
this honor?
The next day, as soon as it was light, Passepartout rapped
vigorously at his master's door. Mr. Fogg opened it, and asked,
"What's the matter, Passepartout?"
"What is it, sir? Why, I've just this instant found out -"
"What?"
"That we might have made the tour of the world in only
seventy-eight days."
"No doubt," returned Mr. Fogg, "by not crossing India. But if I
had not crossed India, I should not have saved Aouda. She would
not have been my wife, and -"
Mr. Fogg quietly shut the door.
Phileas Fogg had won his wager, and had made his journey around
the world in eighty days. To do this he had employed every
means of conveyance - steamers, railways, carriages, yachts,
trading-vessels, sledges, elephants. The eccentric gentleman had
throughout displayed all his marvelous qualifies of coolness and
exactitude. But what then? What had he really gained by all this
trouble? What had he brought back from this long and weary journey?
Nothing, say you? Perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman, who,
strange as it may appear, made him the happiest of men!
Truly, would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?

Première Partie 2
Un écueil fuyant
L’année 1866 fut marquée par un événement bizarre, un phénomène
inexpliqué et inexplicable que personne n’a sans doute oublié. Sans parler
des rumeurs qui agitaient les populations des ports et surexcitaient l’esprit
public à l’intérieur des continents les gens de mer furent particulièrement
émus. Les négociants, armateurs, capitaines de navires, skippers et masters
de l’Europe et de l’Amérique, officiers des marines militaires de tous pays,
et, après eux, les gouvernements des divers États des deux continents, se
préoccupèrent de ce fait au plus haut point.
En effet, depuis quelque temps, plusieurs navires s’étaient rencontrés sur
mer avec « une chose énorme » un objet long, fusiforme, parfois
phosphorescent, infiniment plus vaste et plus rapide qu’une baleine.
Les faits relatifs à cette apparition, consignés aux divers livres de bord,
s’accordaient assez exactement sur la structure de l’objet ou de l’être en
question, la vitesse inouïe de ses mouvements, la puissance surprenante de
sa locomotion, la vie particulière dont il semblait doué. Si c’était un cétacé,
il surpassait en volume tous ceux que la science avait classés jusqu’alors.
Ni Cuvier, ni Lacépède, ni M. Dumeril, ni M. de Quatrefages n’eussent
admis l’existence d’un tel monstre — à moins de l’avoir vu, ce qui
s’appelle vu de leurs propres yeux de savants.
A prendre la moyenne des observations faites à diverses reprises — en
rejetant les évaluations timides qui assignaient à cet objet une longueur de
deux cents pieds et en repoussant les opinions exagérées qui le disaient
large d’un mille et long de trois — on pouvait affirmer, cependant, que cet
être phénoménal dépassait de beaucoup toutes les dimensions admises
jusqu’à ce jour par les ichtyologistes — s’il existait toutefois.
Or, il existait, le fait en lui−même n’était plus niable, et, avec ce penchant
qui pousse au merveilleux la cervelle humaine, on comprendra l’émotion
Un écueil fuyant 3
produite dans le monde entier par cette surnaturelle apparition. Quant à la
rejeter au rang des fables, il fallait y renoncer.
En effet, le 20 juillet 1866, le steamer Governor−Higginson, de Calcutta
and Burnach steam navigation Company, avait rencontré cette masse
mouvante à cinq milles dans l’est des côtes de l’Australie. Le capitaine
Baker se crut, tout d’abord, en présence d’un écueil inconnu ; il se
disposait même à en déterminer la situation exacte, quand deux colonnes
d’eau, projetées par l’inexplicable objet, s’élancèrent en sifflant à cent
cinquante pieds dans l’air. Donc, à moins que cet écueil ne fût soumis aux
expansions intermittentes d’un geyser, le Governor−Higginson avait
affaire bel et bien à quelque mammifère aquatique, inconnu jusque−là, qui
rejetait par ses évents des colonnes d’eau, mélangées d’air et de vapeur.
Pareil fait fut également observé le 23 juillet de la même année, dans les
mers du Pacifique, par le Cristobal−Colon, de West India and Pacific
steam navigation Company. Donc, ce cétacé extraordinaire pouvait se
transporter d’un endroit à un autre avec une vélocité surprenante, puisque à
trois jours d’intervalle, le Governor−Higginson et le Cristobal−Colon
l’avaient observé en deux points de la carte séparés par une distance de
plus de sept cents lieues marines. Quinze jours plus tard, à deux mille
lieues de là l’Helvetia, de la Compagnie Nationale, et le Shannon, du
Royal−Mail, marchant à contrebord dans cette portion de l’Atlantique
comprise entre les États−Unis et l’Europe, se signalèrent respectivement le
monstre par 42°15’de latitude nord, et 60°35’de longitude à l’ouest du
méridien de Greenwich. Dans cette observation simultanée, on crut
pouvoir évaluer la longueur minimum du mammifère à plus de trois cent
cinquante pieds anglais, puisque le Shannon et l’Helvetia étaient de
dimension inférieure à lui, bien qu’ils mesurassent cent mètres de l’étrave
à l’étambot. Or, les plus vastes baleines, celles qui fréquentent les parages
des îles Aléoutiennes, le Kulammak et l’Umgullick, n’ont jamais dépassé
la longueur de cinquante−six mètres, — si même elles l’atteignent.
Ces rapports arrivés coup sur coup, de nouvelles observations faites à bord
du transatlantique le Pereire, un abordage entre l’Etna, de la ligne Inman,
et le monstre, un procès−verbal dressé par les officiers de la frégate
française la Normandie, un très sérieux relèvement obtenu par l’état−major
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un écueil fuyant 4
du commodore Fitz−James à bord du Lord−Clyde, émurent profondément
l’opinion publique. Dans les pays d’humeur légère, on plaisanta le
phénomène, mais les pays graves et pratiques, l’Angleterre, l’Amérique,
l’Allemagne, s’en préoccupèrent vivement.
Partout dans les grands centres, le monstre devint à la mode ; on le chanta
dans les cafés, on le bafoua dans les journaux, on le joua sur les théâtres.
Les canards eurent là une belle occasion de pondre des oeufs de toute
couleur. On vit réapparaître dans les journaux — à court de copie — tous
les êtres imaginaires et gigantesques, depuis la baleine blanche, le terrible
« Moby Dick » des régions hyperboréennes, jusqu’au Kraken démesuré,
dont les tentacules peuvent enlacer un bâtiment de cinq cents tonneaux et
l’entraîner dans les abîmes de l’Océan. On reproduisit même les
procès−verbaux des temps anciens les opinions d’Aristote et de Pline, qui
admettaient l’existence de ces monstres, puis les récits norvégiens de
l’évêque Pontoppidan, les relations de Paul Heggede, et enfin les rapports
de M. Harrington, dont la bonne foi ne peut être soupçonnée, quand il
affirme avoir vu, étant à bord du Castillan, en 1857, cet énorme serpent qui
n’avait jamais fréquenté jusqu’alors que les mers de l’ancien
Constitutionnel.
Alors éclata l’interminable polémique des crédules et des incrédules dans
les sociétés savantes et les journaux scientifiques. La « question du
monstre » enflamma les esprits. Les journalistes, qui font profession de
science en lutte avec ceux qui font profession d’esprit, versèrent des flots
d’encre pendant cette mémorable campagne ; quelques−uns même, deux
ou trois gouttes de sang, car du serpent de mer, ils en vinrent aux
personnalités les plus offensantes.
Six mois durant, la guerre se poursuivit avec des chances diverses. Aux
articles de fond de l’Institut géographique du Brésil, de l’Académie royale
des sciences de Berlin, de l’Association Britannique, de l’Institution
Smithsonnienne de Washington, aux discussions du The Indian
Archipelago, du Cosmos de l’abbé Moigno, des Mittheilungen de
Petermann, aux chroniques scientifiques des grands journaux de la France
et de l’étranger, la petite presse ripostait avec une verve intarissable. Ses
20 000 lieues sous les mers

spirituels écrivains parodiant un mot de Linné, cité par les adversaires du
monstre, soutinrent en effet que « la nature ne faisait pas de sots », et ils
adjurèrent leurs contemporains de ne point donner un démenti à la nature,
en admettant l’existence des Krakens, des serpents de mer, des « Moby
Dick », et autres élucubrations de marins en délire. Enfin, dans un article
d’un journal satirique très redouté, le plus aimé de ses rédacteurs, brochant
sur le tout, poussa au monstre, comme Hippolyte, lui porta un dernier coup
et l’acheva au milieu d’un éclat de rire universel. L’esprit avait vaincu la
science.
Pendant les premiers mois de l’année 1867, la question parut être enterrée,
et elle ne semblait pas devoir renaître, quand de nouveaux faits furent
portés à la connaissance du public. Il ne s’agit plus alors d’un problème
scientifique à résoudre, mais bien d’un danger réel sérieux à éviter. La
question prit une tout autre face. Le monstre redevint îlot, rocher, écueil,
mais écueil fuyant, indéterminable, insaisissable.
Le 5 mars 1867, le Moravian, de Montréal Océan Company, se trouvant
pendant la nuit par 27°30’de latitude et 72°15’de longitude, heurta de sa
hanche de tribord un roc qu’aucune carte ne marquait dans ces parages.
Sous l’effort combiné du vent et de ses quatre cents chevaux−vapeur, il
marchait à la vitesse de treize noeuds. Nul doute que sans la qualité
supérieure de sa coque, le Moravian, ouvert au choc, ne se fût englouti
avec les deux cent trente−sept passagers qu’il ramenait du Canada.
L’accident était arrivé vers cinq heures du matin, lorsque le jour
commençait à poindre. Les officiers de quart se précipitèrent à l’arrière du
bâtiment. Ils examinèrent l’Océan avec la plus scrupuleuse attention. Ils ne
virent rien, si ce n’est un fort remous qui brisait à trois encablures, comme
si les nappes liquides eussent été violemment battues. Le relèvement du
lieu fut exactement pris, et le Moravian continua sa route sans avaries
apparentes. Avait−il heurté une roche sous−marine, ou quelque énorme
épave d’un naufrage ? On ne put le savoir ; mais, examen fait de sa carène
dans les bassins de radoub, il fut reconnu qu’une partie de la quille avait
été brisée.

Ce fait, extrêmement grave en lui−même, eût peut−être été oublié comme
tant d’autres, si, trois semaines après, il ne se fût reproduit dans des
conditions identiques. Seulement, grâce à la nationalité du navire victime
de ce nouvel abordage, grâce à la réputation de la Compagnie à laquelle ce
navire appartenait, l’événement eut un retentissement immense.
Personne n’ignore le nom du célèbre armateur anglais Cunard. Cet
intelligent industriel fonda, en 1840, un service postal entre Liverpool et
Halifax, avec trois navires en bois et à roues d’une force de quatre cents
chevaux, et d’une jauge de onze cent soixante−deux tonneaux. Huit ans
après, le matériel de la Compagnie s’accroissait de quatre navires de six
cent cinquante chevaux et de dix−huit cent vingt tonnes, et, deux ans plus
tard, de deux autres bâtiments supérieurs en puissance et en tonnage. En
1853, la compagnie Cunard, dont le privilège pour le transport des
dépêches venait d’être renouvelé, ajouta successivement à son matériel
l’Arabia, le Persia, le China, le Scotia, le Java, le Russia, tous navires de
première marche, et les plus vastes qui, après le Great−Eastern, eussent
jamais sillonné les mers. Ainsi donc, en 1867, la Compagnie possédait
douze navires, dont huit à roues et quatre à hélices.
Si je donne ces détails très succincts, c’est afin que chacun sache bien
quelle est l’importance de cette compagnie de transports maritimes, connue
du monde entier pour son intelligente gestion. Nulle entreprise de
navigation transocéanienne n’a été conduite avec plus d’habileté ; nulle
affaire n’a été couronnée de plus de succès. Depuis vingt−six ans, les
navires Cunard ont traversé deux mille fois l’Atlantique, et jamais un
voyage n’a été manqué, jamais un retard n’a eu lieu, jamais ni une lettre, ni
un homme, ni un bâtiment n’ont été perdus. Aussi, les passagers
choisissent−ils encore, malgré la concurrence puissante que lui fait la
France, la ligne Cunard de préférence à toute autre, ainsi qu’il appert d’un
relevé fait sur les documents officiels des dernières années. Ceci dit,
personne ne s’étonnera du retentissement que provoqua l’accident arrivé à
l’un de ses plus beaux steamers.
Le 13 avril 1867, la mer étant belle, la brise maniable, le Scotia se trouvait
par 15°12’de longitude et 45°37’de latitude. Il marchait avec une vitesse de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un écueil fuyant 7
treize noeuds quarante−trois centièmes sous la poussée de ses mille
chevaux−vapeur. Ses roues battaient la mer avec une régularité parfaite.
Son tirant d’eau était alors de six mètres soixante−dix centimètres, et son
déplacement de six mille six cent vingt−quatre mètres cubes.
A quatre heures dix−sept minutes du soir, pendant le lunch des passagers
réunis dans le grand salon, un choc, peu sensible, en somme, se produisit
sur la coque du Scotia, par sa hanche et un peu en arrière de la roue de
bâbord.
Le Scotia n’avait pas heurté, il avait été heurté, et plutôt par un instrument
tranchant ou perforant que contondant. L’abordage avait semblé si léger
que personne ne s’en fût inquiété à bord, sans le cri des caliers qui
remontèrent sur le pont en s’écriant :
« Nous coulons ! nous coulons ! »
Tout d’abord, les passagers furent très effrayés ; mais le capitaine
Anderson se hâta de les rassurer. En effet, le danger ne pouvait être
imminent. Le Scotia, divisé en sept compartiments par des cloisons
étanches, devait braver impunément une voie d’eau.
Le capitaine Anderson se rendit immédiatement dans la cale. Il reconnut
que le cinquième compartiment avait été envahi par la mer, et la rapidité de
l’envahissement prouvait que la voie d’eau était considérable. Fort
heureusement, ce compartiment ne renfermait pas les chaudières, car les
feux se fussent subitement éteints.
Le capitaine Anderson fit stopper immédiatement, et l’un des matelots
plongea pour reconnaître l’avarie. Quelques instants après, on constatait
l’existence d’un trou large de deux mètres dans la carène du steamer. Une
telle voie d’eau ne pouvait être aveuglée, et le Scotia, ses roues à demi
noyées, dut continuer ainsi son voyage. Il se trouvait alors à trois cent
mille du cap Clear, et après trois jours d’un retard qui inquiéta vivement
Liverpool, il entra dans les bassins de la Compagnie.
Les ingénieurs procédèrent alors à la visite du Scotia, qui fut mis en cale
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un écueil fuyant 8
sèche. Ils ne purent en croire leurs yeux. A deux mètres et demi
au−dessous de la flottaison s’ouvrait une déchirure régulière, en forme de
triangle isocèle. La cassure de la tôle était d’une netteté parfaite, et elle
n’eût pas été frappée plus sûrement à l’emporte−pièce. Il fallait donc que
l’outil perforant qui l’avait produite fût d’une trempe peu commune — et
après avoir été lancé avec une force prodigieuse, ayant ainsi perce une tôle
de quatre centimètres, il avait dû se retirer de lui−même par un mouvement
rétrograde et vraiment inexplicable.
Tel était ce dernier fait, qui eut pour résultat de passionner à nouveau
l’opinion publique. Depuis ce moment, en effet, les sinistres maritimes qui
n’avaient pas de cause déterminée furent mis sur le compte du monstre. Ce
fantastique animal endossa la responsabilité de tous ces naufrages, dont le
ombre est malheureusement considérable ; car sur trois mille navires dont
la perte est annuellement relevée au Bureau−Veritas, le chiffre des navires
à vapeur ou à voiles, supposés perdus corps et biens par suite d’absence de
nouvelles, ne s’élève pas à moins de deux cents !
Or, ce fut le « monstre » qui, justement ou injustement, fut accusé de leur
disparition, et, grâce à lui, les communications entre les divers continents
devenant de plus en plus dangereuses, le public se déclara et demanda
catégoriquement que les mers fussent enfin débarrassées et à tout prix de
ce formidable cétacé.

Un écueil fuyant 9
Le pour et le contre
A l’époque où ces événements se produisirent, je revenais d’une
exploration scientifique entreprise dans les mauvaises terres du Nebraska,
aux États−Unis. En ma qualité de professeur−suppléant au Muséum
d’histoire naturelle de Paris, le gouvernement français m’avait joint à cette
expédition. Après six mois passés dans le Nebraska, chargé de précieuses
collections, j’arrivai à New York vers la fin de mars. Mon départ pour la
France était fixé aux premiers jours de mai. Je m’occupais donc, en
attendant, de classer mes richesses minéralogiques, botaniques et
zoologiques, quand arriva l’incident du Scotia.
J’étais parfaitement au courant de la question à l’ordre du jour, et comment
ne l’aurais−je pas été ? J’avais lu et relu tous les journaux américains et
européens sans être plus avancé. Ce mystère m’intriguait. Dans
l’impossibilité de me former une opinion, je flottais d’un extrême à l’autre.
Qu’il y eut quelque chose, cela ne pouvait être douteux, et les incrédules
étaient invités à mettre le doigt sur la plaie du Scotia.
A mon arrivée à New York, la question brûlait. L’hypothèse de l’îlot
flottant, de l’écueil insaisissable, soutenue par quelques esprits peu
compétents, était absolument abandonnée. Et, en effet, à moins que cet
écueil n’eût une machine dans le ventre, comment pouvait−il se déplacer
avec une rapidité si prodigieuse ?
De même fut repoussée l’existence d’une coque flottante, d’une énorme
épave, et toujours à cause de la rapidité du déplacement.
Restaient donc deux solutions possibles de la question, qui créaient deux
clans très distincts de partisans : d’un côté, ceux qui tenaient pour un
monstre d’une force colossale ; de l’autre, ceux qui tenaient pour un bateau
« sous−marin » d’une extrême puissance motrice.
Le pour et le contre 10
Or, cette dernière hypothèse, admissible après tout, ne put résister aux
enquêtes qui furent poursuivies dans les deux mondes. Qu’un simple
particulier eût à sa disposition un tel engin mécanique, c’était peu
probable. Où et quand l’eut−il fait construire, et comment aurait−il tenu
cette construction secrète ?
Seul, un gouvernement pouvait posséder une pareille machine destructive,
et, en ces temps désastreux où l’homme s’ingénie à multiplier la puissance
des armes de guerre, il était possible qu’un État essayât à l’insu des autres
ce formidable engin. Après les chassepots, les torpilles, après les torpilles,
les béliers sous−marins, puis la réaction. Du moins, je l’espère.
Mais l’hypothèse d’une machine de guerre tomba encore devant la
déclaration des gouvernements. Comme il s’agissait là d’un intérêt public,
puisque les communications transocéaniennes en souffraient, la franchise
des gouvernements ne pouvait être mise en doute. D’ailleurs, comment
admettre que la construction de ce bateau sous−marin eût échappé aux
yeux du public ? Garder le secret dans ces circonstances est très difficile
pour un particulier, et certainement impossible pour un Etat dont tous les
actes sont obstinément surveillés par les puissances rivales.
Donc, après enquêtes faites en Angleterre, en France, en Russie, en Prusse,
en Espagne, en Italie, en Amérique, voire même en Turquie, l’hypothèse
d’un Monitor sous−marin fut définitivement rejetée.
A mon arrivée à New York, plusieurs personnes m’avaient fait l’honneur
de me consulter sur le phénomène en question. J’avais publié en France un
ouvrage in−quarto en deux volumes intitulé : Les Mystères des grands
fonds sous−marins. Ce livre, particulièrement goûté du monde savant,
faisait de moi un spécialiste dans cette partie assez obscure de l’histoire
naturelle. Mon avis me fut demandé. Tant que je pus nier du fait, je me
renfermai dans une absolue négation. Mais bientôt, collé au mur, je dus
m’expliquer catégoriquement. Et même, « l’honorable Pierre Aronnax,
professeur au Muséum de Paris », fut mis en demeure par le New
York−Herald de formuler une opinion quelconque.
Je m’exécutai. Je parlai faute de pouvoir me taire. Je discutai la question
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pour et le contre 11
sous toutes ses faces, politiquement et scientifiquement, et je donne ici un
extrait d’un article très nourri que je publiai dans le numéro du 30 avril.
« Ainsi donc, disais−je, après avoir examiné une à une les diverses
hypothèses, toute autre supposition étant rejetée, il faut nécessairement
admettre l’existence d’un animal marin d’une puissance excessive.
« Les grandes profondeurs de l’Océan nous sont totalement inconnues. La
sonde n’a su les atteindre. Que se passe−t−il dans ces abîmes reculés ?
Quels êtres habitent et peuvent habiter à douze ou quinze milles
au−dessous de la surface des eaux ? Quel est l’organisme de ces animaux ?
On saurait à peine le conjecturer.
« Cependant, la solution du problème qui m’est soumis peut affecter la
forme du dilemme.
« Ou nous connaissons toutes les variétés d’êtres qui peuplent notre
planète, ou nous ne les connaissons pas.
« Si nous ne les connaissons pas toutes, si la nature a encore des secrets
pour nous en ichtyologie, rien de plus acceptable que d’admettre
l’existence de poissons ou de cétacés, d’espèces ou même de genres
nouveaux, d’une organisation essentiellement « fondrière », qui habitent
les couches inaccessibles à la sonde, et qu’un événement quelconque, une
fantaisie, un caprice, si l’on veut, ramène à de longs intervalles vers le
niveau supérieur de l’Océan.
« Si, au contraire, nous connaissons toutes les espèces vivantes, il faut
nécessairement chercher l’animal en question parmi les êtres marins déjà
catalogués, et dans ce cas, je serai disposé à admettre l’existence d’un
Narwal géant.
« Le narwal vulgaire ou licorne de mer atteint souvent une longueur de
soixante pieds. Quintuplez, décuplez même cette dimension, donnez à ce
cétacé une force proportionnelle à sa taille, accroissez ses armes
offensives, et vous obtenez l’animal voulu. Il aura les proportions
déterminées par les Officiers du Shannon, l’instrument exigé par la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pour et le contre 12
perforation du Scotia, et la puissance nécessaire pour entamer la coque
d’un steamer.
« En effet, le narwal est armé d’une sorte d’épée d’ivoire, d’une
hallebarde, suivant l’expression de certains naturalistes. C’est une dent
principale qui a la dureté de l’acier. On a trouvé quelques−unes de ces
dents implantées dans le corps des baleines que le narwal attaque toujours
avec succès.
D’autres ont été arrachées, non sans peine, de carènes de vaisseauxqu’elles
avaient percées d’outre en outre, comme un foret perce un tonneau. Le
musée de la Faculté de médecine de Paris possède une de ces défenses
longue de deux mètres vingt−cinq centimètres, et large de quarante−huit
centimètres à sa base !
« Eh bien ! supposez l’arme dix fois plus forte, et l’animal dix fois plus
puissant, lancez−le avec une rapidité de vingt milles à l’heure, multipliez
sa masse par sa vitesse, et vous obtenez un choc capable de produire la
catastrophe demandée.
« Donc, jusqu’à plus amples informations, j’opinerais pour une licorne de
mer, de dimensions colossales, armée, non plus d’une hallebarde, mais
d’un véritable éperon comme les frégates cuirassées ou les « rams » de
guerre, dont elle aurait à la fois la masse et la puissance motrice.
« Ainsi s’expliquerait ce phénomène inexplicable — à moins qu’il n’y ait
rien, en dépit de ce qu’on a entrevu, vu, senti et ressenti — ce qui est
encore possible ! »
Ces derniers mots étaient une lâcheté de ma part ; mais je voulais jusqu’à
un certain point couvrir ma dignité de professeur, et ne pas trop prêter à
rire aux Américains, qui rient bien, quand ils rient. Je me réservais une
échappatoire.
Au fond, j’admettais l’existence du « monstre ».
Mon article fut chaudement discuté, ce qui lui valut un grand
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pour et le contre 13
retentissement. Il rallia un certain nombre de partisans. La solution qu’il
proposait, d’ailleurs, laissait libre carrière à l’imagination. L’esprit humain
se plaît à ces conceptions grandioses d’êtres surnaturels. Or la mer est
précisément leur meilleur véhicule, le seul milieu où ces géants près
desquels les animaux terrestres, éléphants ou rhinocéros, ne sont que des
nains — puissent se produire et se développer. Les masses liquides
transportent les plus grandes espèces connues de mammifères, et peut−être
recèlent−elles des mollusques d’une incomparable taille, des crustacés
effrayants à contempler, tels que seraient des homards de cent mètres ou
des crabes pesant deux cents tonnes ! Pourquoi nous ? Autrefois, les
animaux terrestres, contemporains des époques géologiques, les
quadrupèdes, les quadrumanes, les reptiles, les oiseaux étaient construits
sur des gabarits gigantesques. Le Créateur les avait jetés dans un moule
colossal que le temps a réduit peu à peu. Pourquoi la mer, dans ses
profondeurs ignorées, n’aurait−elle pas gardé ces vastes échantillons de la
vie d’un autre âge, elle qui ne se modifie jamais, alors que le noyau
terrestre change presque incessamment ? Pourquoi ne cacherait−elle pas
dans son sein les dernières variétés de ces espèces titanesques, dont les
années sont des siècles, et les siècles des millénaires ?
Mais je me laisse entraîner à des rêveries qu’il ne m’appartient plus
d’entretenir ! Trêve à ces chimères que le temps a changées pour moi en
réalités terribles. Je le répète, l’opinion se fit alors sur la nature du
phénomène, et le public admit sans conteste l’existence d’un être
prodigieux qui n’avait rien de commun avec les fabuleux serpents de mer.
Mais si les uns ne virent là qu’un problème purement scientifique à
résoudre, les autres, plus positifs, surtout en Amérique et en Angleterre,
furent d’avis de purger l’Océan de ce redoutable monstre, afin de rassurer
les communications transocéaniennes. Les journaux industriels et
commerciaux traitèrent la question principalement à ce point de vue. La
Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, le Lloyd, le Paquebot, la Revue maritime
et coloniale, toutes les feuilles dévouées aux Compagnies d’assurances qui
menaçaient d’élever le taux de leurs primes, furent unanimes sur ce point.
L’opinion publique s’étant prononcée, les États de l’Union se déclarèrent

les premiers. On fit à New York les préparatifs d’une expédition destinée à
poursuivre le narwal. Une frégate de grande marche l’Abraham−Lincoln,
se mit en mesure de prendre la mer au plus tôt. Les arsenaux furent ouverts
au commandant Farragut, qui pressa activement l’armement de sa frégate.
Précisément, et ainsi que cela arrive toujours, du moment que l’on se fut
décidé à poursuivre le monstre, le monstre ne reparut plus. Pendant deux
mois, personne n’en entendit parler. Aucun navire ne le rencontra. Il
semblait que cette Licorne eût connaissance des complots qui se tramaient
contre elle. On en avait tant causé, et même par le câble transatlantique !
Aussi les plaisants prétendaient−ils que cette fine mouche avait arrêté au
passage quelque télégramme dont elle faisait maintenant son profit.
Donc, la frégate armée pour une campagne lointaine et pourvue de
formidables engins de pêche, on ne savait plus où la diriger. Et
l’impatience allait croissant, quand, le 2 juillet, on apprit qu’un steamer de
la ligne de San Francisco de Californie à Shangaï avait revu l’animal, trois
semaines auparavant, dans les mers septentrionales du Pacifique.
L’émotion causée par cette nouvelle fut extrême. On n’accorda pas
vingt−quatre heures de répit au commandant Farragut. Ses vivres étaient
embarques. Ses soutes regorgeaient de charbon. Pas un homme ne
manquait à son rôle d’équipage. Il n’avait qu’à allumer ses fourneaux, à
chauffer, à démarrer ! On ne lui eût pas pardonné une demi−journée de
retard ! D’ailleurs, le commandant Farragut ne demandait qu’à partir.
Trois heures avant que l’Abraham−Lincoln ne quittât la pier de Brooklyn,
je reçus une lettre libellée en ces termes :
Monsieur Aronnax, professeur au Muséum de Paris, Fifth Avenue hotel.
New York.
« Monsieur,
Si vous voulez vous joindre à l’expédition de l’Abraham−Lincoln, le
gouvernement de l’Union verra avec plaisir que la France soit représentée
20 000 lieues sous les mers

par vous dans cette entreprise. Le commandant Farragut tient une cabine
à votre disposition.
Très cordialement, votre J. −B. HOBSON,
Secrétaire de la marine. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pour et le contre 16
Comme il plaira à monsieur
Trois secondes avant l’arrivée de la lettre de J. −B. Hobson, je ne songeais
pas plus a poursuivre la Licorne qu’à tenter le passage du nord−ouest.
Trois secondes après avoir lu la lettre de l’honorable secrétaire de la
marine, je comprenais enfin que ma véritable vocation, l’unique but de ma
vie, était de chasser ce monstre inquiétant et d’en purger le monde.
Cependant, je revenais d’un pénible voyage, fatigué, avide de repos. Je
n’aspirais plus qu’à revoir mon pays, mes amis, mon petit logement du
Jardin des Plantes, mes chères et précieuses collections ! Mais rien ne put
me retenir. J’oubliai tout, fatigues, amis, collections, et j’acceptai sans plus
de réflexions l’offre du gouvernement américain.
« D’ailleurs, pensai−je, tout chemin ramène en Europe, et la Licorne sera
assez aimable pour m’entraîner vers les côtes de France ! Ce digne animal
se laissera prendre dans les mers d’Europe — pour mon agrément
personnel — et je ne veux pas rapporter moins d’un demi mètre de sa
hallebarde d’ivoire au Muséum d’histoire naturelle. »
Mais, en attendant, il me fallait chercher ce narwal dans le nord de l’océan
Pacifique ; ce qui, pour revenir en France, était prendre le chemin des
antipodes.
« Conseil ! » criai−je d’une voix impatiente.
Conseil était mon domestique. Un garçon dévoué qui m’accompagnait
dans tous mes voyages ; un brave Flamand que j’aimais et qui me le
rendait bien, un être phlegmatique par nature, régulier par principe, zélé
par habitude, s’étonnant peu des surprises de la vie, très adroit de ses
mains, apte à tout service, et, en dépit de son nom, ne donnant jamais de
conseils — même quand on ne lui en demandait pas.
Comme il plaira à monsieur 17
A se frotter aux savants de notre petit monde du Jardin des Plantes, Conseil
en était venu à savoir quelque chose. J’avais en lui un spécialiste, très ferré
sur la classification en histoire naturelle, parcourant avec une agilité
d’acrobate toute l’échelle des embranchements des groupes, des classes,
des sous−classes, des ordres, des familles, des genres, des sous−genres, des
espèces et des variétés. Mais sa science s’arrêtait là. Classer, c’était sa vie,
et il n’en savait pas davantage. Très versé dans la théorie de la
classification, peu dans la pratique, il n’eût pas distingué, je crois, un
cachalot d’une baleine ! Et cependant, quel brave et digne garçon !
Conseil, jusqu’ici et depuis dix ans, m’avait suivi partout où m’entraînait
la science. Jamais une réflexion de lui sur la longueur ou la fatigue d’un
voyage. Nulle objection à boucler sa valise pour un pays quelconque,
Chine ou Congo, si éloigné qu’il fût. Il allait là comme ici, sans en
demander davantage. D’ailleurs d’une belle santé qui défiait toutes les
maladies ; des muscles solides, mais pas de nerfs, pas l’apparence de nerfs
au moral, s’entend.
Ce garçon avait trente ans, et son âge était à celui de son maître comme
quinze est à vingt. Qu’on m’excuse de dire ainsi que j’avais quarante ans.
Seulement, Conseil avait un défaut. Formaliste enragé il ne me parlait
jamais qu’à la troisième personne — au point d’en être agaçant.
« Conseil ! » répétai−je, tout en commençant d’une main fébrile mes
préparatifs de départ.
Certainement, j’étais sûr de ce garçon si dévoué. D’ordinaire, je ne lui
demandais jamais s’il lui convenait ou non de me suivre dans mes
voyages, mais cette fois, il s’agissait d’une expédition qui pouvait
indéfiniment se prolonger, d’une entreprise hasardeuse, à la poursuite d’un
animal capable de couler une frégate comme une coque de noix ! Il y avait
là matière à réflexion, même pour l’homme le plus impassible du monde !
Qu’allait dire Conseil ?

Comme il plaira à monsieur 18
« Conseil ! » criai−je une troisième fois.
Conseil parut.
« Monsieur m’appelle ? dit−il en entrant.
— Oui, mon garçon. Prépare−moi, prépare−toi. Nous partons dans deux
heures.
— Comme il plaira à monsieur, répondit tranquillement Conseil.
— Pas un instant à perdre. Serre dans ma malle tous mes ustensiles de
voyage, des habits, des chemises, des chaussettes, sans compter, mais le
plus que tu pourras, et hâte−toi !
— Et les collections de monsieur ? fit observer Conseil.
— On s’en occupera plus tard.
— Quoi ! les archiotherium, les hyracotherium, les oréodons, les
chéropotamus et autres carcasses de monsieur ?
— On les gardera à l’hôtel.
— Et le babiroussa vivant de monsieur ?
— On le nourrira pendant notre absence. D’ailleurs, je donnerai l’ordre de
nous expédier en France notre ménagerie.
— Nous ne retournons donc pas à Paris ? demanda Conseil.
— Si... certainement... répondis−je évasivement, mais en faisant un
crochet.
— Le crochet qui plaira à monsieur.

Comme il plaira à monsieur 19
— Oh ! ce sera peu de chose ! Un chemin un peu moins direct, voilà tout.
Nous prenons passage sur l’Abraham−Lincoln...
— Comme il conviendra à monsieur, répondit paisiblement Conseil.
— Tu sais, mon ami, il s’agit du monstre... du fameux narwal... Nous
allons en purger les mers ! ... L’auteur d’un ouvrage in−quarto en deux
volumes sur les Mystères des grands fonds sous−marins ne peut se
dispenser de s’embarquer avec le commandant Farragut. Mission
glorieuse, mais... dangereuse aussi ! On ne sait pas où l’on va ! Ces
bêtes−là peuvent être très capricieuses ! Mais nous irons quand même !
Nous avons un commandant qui n’a pas froid aux yeux ! ...
— Comme fera monsieur, je ferai, répondit Conseil.
— Et songes−y bien ! car je ne veux rien te cacher. C’est là un de ces
voyages dont on ne revient pas toujours !
— Comme il plaira à monsieur. »
Un quart d’heure après, nos malles étaient prêtes. Conseil avait fait en un
tour de main, et j’étais sûr que rien ne manquait, car ce garçon classait les
chemises et les habits aussi bien que les oiseaux ou les mammifères.
L’ascenseur de l’hôtel nous déposa au grand vestibule de l’entresol. Je
descendis les quelques marches qui conduisaient au rez−de−chaussée. Je
réglai ma note à ce vaste comptoir toujours assiégé par une foule
considérable. Je donnai l’ordre d’expédier pour Paris (France) mes ballots
d’animaux empaillés et de plantes desséchées. Je fis ouvrir un crédit
suffisant au babiroussa, et, Conseil me suivant, je sautai dans une voiture.
Le véhicule à vingt francs la course descendit Broadway jusqu’à
Union−square, suivit Fourth−avenue jusqu’à sa jonction avec
Bowery−street, prit Katrin−street et s’arrêta à la trente−quatrième pier. Là,
le Katrinferryboat nous transporta, hommes, chevaux et voiture, à
Brooklyn, la grande annexe de New York, située sur la rive gauche de la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Comme il plaira à monsieur 20
rivière de l’Est, et en quelques minutes, nous arrivions au quai près duquel
l’Abraham−Lincoln vomissait par ses deux cheminées des torrents de
fumée noire.
Nos bagages furent immédiatement transbordés sur le pont de la frégate. Je
me précipitai à bord. Je demandai le commandant Farragut. Un des
matelots me conduisit sur la dunette, où je me trouvai en présence d’un
officier de bonne mine qui me tendit la main.
« Monsieur Pierre Aronnax ? me dit−il.
— Lui−même, répondis−je. Le commandant Farragut ?
— En personne. Soyez le bienvenu, monsieur le professeur. Votre cabine
vous attend. »
Je saluai, et laissant le commandant aux soins de son appareillage, je me
fis conduire à la cabine qui m’était destinée.
L’Abraham−Lincoln avait été parfaitement choisi et aménagé pour sa
destination nouvelle. C’était une frégate de grande marche, munie
d’appareils surchauffeurs, qui permettaient de porter à sept atmosphères la
tension de sa vapeur. Sous cette pression, l’Abraham−Lincoln atteignait
une vitesse moyenne de dix−huit milles et trois dixièmes à l’heure, vitesse
considérable, mais cependant insuffisante pour lutter avec le gigantesque
cétacé.
Les aménagements intérieurs de la frégate répondaient à ses qualités
nautiques. Je fus très satisfait de ma cabine, située à l’arrière, qui s’ouvrait
sur le carré des officiers.
« Nous serons bien ici, dis−je à Conseil.
— Aussi bien, n’en déplaise à monsieur, répondit Conseil, qu’un
bernard−l’ermite dans la coquille d’un buccin. »
Je laissai Conseil arrimer convenablement nos malles, et je remontai sur le
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Comme il plaira à monsieur 21
pont afin de suivre les préparatifs de l’appareillage.
A ce moment, le commandant Farragut faisait larguer les dernières amarres
qui retenaient l’Abraham−Lincoln à la pier de Brooklyn. Ainsi donc, un
quart d’heure de retard, moins même, et la frégate partait sans moi, et je
manquais cette expédition extraordinaire, surnaturelle, invraisemblable,
dont le récit véridique pourra bien trouver cependant quelques incrédules.
Mais le commandant Farragut ne voulait perdre ni un jour, ni une heure
pour rallier les mers dans lesquelles l’animal venait d’être signalé. Il fit
venir son ingénieur.
« Sommes−nous en pression ? lui demanda−t−il.
— Oui, monsieur, répondit l’ingénieur.
— Go ahead », cria le commandant Farragut.
A cet ordre, qui fut transmis à la machine au moyen d’appareils à air
comprimé, les mécaniciens firent agir la roue de la mise en train. La vapeur
siffla en se précipitant dans les tiroirs entr’ouverts. Les longs pistons
horizontaux gémirent et poussèrent les bielles de l’arbre. Les branches de
l’hélice battirent les flots avec une rapidité croissante, et
l’Abraham−lincoln s’avança majestueusement au milieu d’une centaine de
ferry−boats et de tenders chargés de spectateurs, qui lui faisaient cortège.
Les quais de Brooklyn et toute la partie de New York qui borde la rivière
de l’Est étaient couverts de curieux. Trois hurrahs, partis de cinq cent mille
poitrines. éclatèrent successivement. Des milliers de mouchoirs s’agitèrent
au−dessus de la masse compacte et saluèrent l’Abraham−Lincoln jusqu’à
son arrivée dans les eaux de l’Hudson, à la pointe de cette presqu’île
allongée qui forme la ville de New York.
Alors, la frégate, suivant du côté de New−Jersey l’admirable rive droite du
fleuve toute chargée de villas, passa entre les forts qui la saluèrent de leurs
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Comme il plaira à monsieur 22
plus gros canons. L’Abraham−Lincoln répondit en amenant et en hissant
trois fois le pavillon américain, dont les trente−neuf étoiles
resplendissaient à sa corne d’artimon ; puis, modifiant sa marche pour
prendre le chenal balisé qui s’arrondit dans la baie intérieure formée par la
pointe de Sandy−Hook, il rasa cette langue sablonneuse où quelques
milliers de spectateurs l’acclamèrent encore une fois.
Le cortège des boats et des tenders suivait toujours la frégate, et il ne la
quitta qu’à la hauteur du light−boat dont les deux feux marquent l’entrée
des passes de New York.
Trois heures sonnaient alors. Le pilote descendit dans son canot, et
rejoignit la petite goélette qui l’attendait sous le vent. Les feux furent
poussés ; l’hélice battit plus rapidement les flots ; la frégate longea la côte
jaune et basse de Long−lsland, et, à huit heures du soir, après avoir perdu
dans le nord−ouest les feux de Fire−lsland, elle courut à toute vapeur sur
les sombres eaux de l’Atlantique.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Comme il plaira à monsieur 23
Ned Land
Le commandant Farragut était un bon marin, digne de la frégate qu’il
commandait. Son navire et lui ne faisaient qu’un. Il en était l’âme. Sur la
question du cétacé, aucun doute ne s’élevait dans son esprit, et il ne
permettait pas que l’existence de l’animal fût discutée à son bord. Il y
croyait comme certaines bonnes femmes croient au Léviathan par foi, non
par raison. Le monstre existait, il en délivrerait les mers, il l’avait juré.
C’était une sorte de chevalier de Rhodes, un Dieudonné de Gozon,
marchant à la rencontre du serpent qui désolait son île. Ou le commandant
Farragut tuerait le narwal, ou le narwal tuerait le commandant Farragut.
Pas de milieu.
Les officiers du bord partageaient l’opinion de leur chef. Il fallait les
entendre causer, discuter, disputer, calculer les diverses chances d’une
rencontre, et observer la vaste étendue de l’Océan. Plus d’un s’imposait un
quart volontaire dans les barres de perroquet, qui eût maudit une telle
corvée en toute autre circonstance. Tant que le soleil décrivait son arc
diurne, la mâture était peuplée de matelots auxquels les planches du pont
brûlaient les pieds, et qui n’y pouvaient tenir en place ! Et cependant.
L’Abraham−Lincoln ne tranchait pas encore de son étrave les eaux
suspectes du Pacifique.
Quant à l’équipage, il ne demandait qu’à rencontrer la licorne, à la
harponner. et à la hisser à bord, à la dépecer. Il surveillait la mer avec une
scrupuleuse attention. D’ailleurs, le commandant Farragut parlait d’une
certaine somme de deux mille dollars, réservée à quiconque, mousse ou
matelot, maître ou officier, signalerait l’animal. Je laisse à penser si les
yeux s’exerçaient à bord de l’Abraham−Lincoln.
Pour mon compte, je n’étais pas en reste avec les autres, et je ne laissais à
personne ma part d’observations quotidiennes. La frégate aurait eu cent
Ned Land 24
fois raison de s’appeler l’Argus. Seul entre tous, Conseil protestait par son
indifférence touchant la question qui nous passionnait, et détonnait sur
l’enthousiasme général du bord.
J’ai dit que le commandant Farragut avait soigneusement pourvu son
navire d’appareils propres à pêcher le gigantesque cétacé. Un baleinier
n’eût pas été mieux armé. Nous possédions tous les engins connus, depuis
le harpon qui se lance à la main, jusqu’aux flèches barbelées des
espingoles et aux balles explosibles des canardières. Sur le gaillard d’avant
s’allongeait un canon perfectionné, se chargeant par la culasse, très épais
de parois, très étroit d’âme, et dont le modèle doit figurer à l’Exposition
universelle de 1867. Ce précieux instrument, d’origine américaine,
envoyait sans se gêner, un projectile conique de quatre kilogrammes à une
distance moyenne de seize kilomètres.
Donc, l’Abraham−Lincoln ne manquait d’aucun moyen de destruction.
Mais il avait mieux encore. Il avait Ned Land, le roi des harponneurs.
Ned Land était un Canadien, d’une habileté de main peu commune, et qui
ne connaissait pas d’égal dans son périlleux métier. Adresse et sang−froid,
audace et ruse, il possédait ces qualités à un degré supérieur, et il fallait
être une baleine bien maligne, ou un cachalot singulièrement astucieux
pour échapper à son coup de harpon.
Ned Land avait environ quarante ans. C’était un homme de grande taille —
plus de six pieds anglais — vigoureusement bâti, l’air grave, peu
communicatif, violent parfois, et très rageur quand on le contrariait. Sa
personne provoquait l’attention, et surtout la puissance de son regard qui
accentuait singulièrement sa physionomie.
Je crois que le commandant Farragut avait sagement fait d’engager cet
homme à son bord. Il valait tout l’équipage, à lui seul, pour l’oeil et le
bras. Je ne saurais le mieux comparer qu’à un télescope puissant qui serait
en même temps un canon toujours prêt à partir.
Qui dit Canadien, dit Français, et, si peu communicatif que fût Ned Land,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ned Land 25
je dois avouer qu’il se prit d’une certaine affection pour moi. Ma
nationalité l’attirait sans doute. C’était une occasion pour lui de parler, et
pour moi d’entendre cette vieille langue de Rabelais qui est encore en
usage dans quelques provinces canadiennes. La famille du harponneur était
originaire de Québec, et formait déjà un tribu de hardis pêcheurs à
l’époque où cette ville appartenait à la France.
Peu à peu, Ned prit goût à causer. et j’aimais à entendre le récit de ses
aventures dans les mers polaires. Il racontait ses pêches et ses combats
avec une grande poésie naturelle. Son récit prenait une forme épique, et je
croyais écouter quelque Homère canadien, chantant l’Iliade des régions
hyperboréennes.
Je dépeins maintenant ce hardi compagnon, tel que je le connais
actuellement. C’est que nous sommes devenus de vieux amis, unis de cette
inaltérable amitié qui naît et se cimente dans les plus effrayantes
conjonctures ! Ah ! brave Ned ! je ne demande qu’à vivre cent ans encore,
pour me souvenir plus longtemps de toi !
Et maintenant, quelle était l’opinion de Ned Land sur la question du
monstre marin ? Je dois avouer qu’il ne croyait guère à la licorne, et que,
seul à bord, il ne partageait pas la conviction générale. Il évitait même de
traiter ce sujet, sur lequel je crus devoir l’entreprendre un jour.
Par une magnifique soirée du 30 juillet, c’est−à−dire trois semaines après
notre départ, la frégate se trouvait à la hauteur du cap Blanc, à trente milles
sous le vent des côtes patagonnes. Nous avions dépassé le tropique du
Capricorne, et le détroit de Magellan s’ouvrait à moins de sept cent milles
dans le sud. Avant huit jours, l’Abraham−Lincoln sillonnerait les flots du
Pacifique.
Assis sur la dunette, Ned Land et moi, nous causions de choses et d’autres,
regardant cette mystérieuse mer dont les profondeurs sont restées jusqu’ici
inaccessibles aux regards de l’homme. J’amenai tout naturellement la
conversation sur la licorne géante, et j’examinai les diverses chances de
succès ou d’insuccès de notre expédition. Puis, voyant que Ned me laissait
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ned Land 26
parler sans trop rien dire, je le poussai plus directement.
« Comment, Ned, lui demandai−je, comment pouvez−vous ne pas être
convaincu de l’existence du cétacé que nous poursuivons ? Avez−vous
donc des raisons particulières de vous montrer si incrédule ? »
Le harponneur me regarda pendant quelques instants avant de répondre,
frappa de sa main son large front par un geste qui lui était habituel, ferma
les yeux comme pour se recueillir, et dit enfin :
« Peut−être bien, monsieur Aronnax.
— Cependant, Ned, vous, un baleinier de profession, vous qui êtes
familiarisé avec les grands mammifères marins, vous dont l’imagination
doit aisément accepter l’hypothèse de cétacés énormes, vous devriez être le
dernier à douter en de pareilles circonstances !
— C’est ce qui vous trompe, monsieur le professeur, répondit Ned. Que le
vulgaire croie à des comètes extraordinaires qui traversent l’espace, ou à
l’existence de monstres antédiluviens qui peuplent l’intérieur du globe,
passe encore, mais ni l’astronome, ni le géologue n’admettent de telles
chimères. De même, le baleinier. J’ai poursuivi beaucoup de cétacés, j’en
ai harponné un grand nombre, j’en ai tué plusieurs, mais si puissants et si
bien armés qu’ils fussent, ni leurs queues, ni leurs défenses n’auraient pu
entamer les plaques de tôle d’un steamer.
— Cependant, Ned, on cite des bâtiments que la dent du narwal a traversés
de part en part.
— Des navires en bois, c’est possible, répondit le Canadien, et encore, je
ne les ai jamais vus. Donc, jusqu’à preuve contraire, je nie que baleines,
cachalots ou licornes puissent roduire un pareil effet.
— Écoutez−moi, Ned...
— Non, monsieur le professeur, non. Tout ce que vous voudrez excepté
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ned Land 27
cela. Un poulpe gigantesque, peut−être ? ...
— Encore moins, Ned. Le poulpe n’est qu’un mollusque, et ce nom même
indique le peu de consistance de ses chairs. Eût−il cinq cents pieds de
longueur, le poulpe, qui n’appartient point à l’embranchement des
vertébrés, est tout à fait inoffensif pour des navires tels que le Scotia ou
l’Abraham−Lincoln. Il faut donc rejeter au rang des fables les prouesses
des Krakens ou autres monstres de cette espèce.
— Alors, monsieur le naturaliste, reprit Ned Land d’un ton assez narquois,
vous persistez à admettre l’existence d’un énorme cétacé... ?
— Oui, Ned, je vous le répète avec une conviction qui s’appuie sur la
logique des faits. Je crois à l’existence d’un mammifère, puissamment
organisé, appartenant à l’embranchement des vertébrés, comme les
baleines, les cachalots ou les dauphins, et muni d’une défense cornée dont
la force de pénétration est extrême.
— Hum ! fit le harponneur, en secouant la tête de l’air d’un homme qui ne
veut pas se laisser convaincre...
— Remarquez, mon digne Canadien, repris−je, que si un tel animal existe,
s’il habite les profondeurs de l’Océan, s’il fréquente les couches liquides
situées à quelques milles au−dessous de la surface des eaux, il possède
nécessairement un organisme dont la solidité défie toute comparaison.
— Et pourquoi cet organisme si puissant ? demanda Ned
— Parce qu’il faut une force incalculable pour se maintenir dans les
couches profondes et résister à leur pression.
— Vraiment ? dit Ned qui me regardait en clignant de l’oeil.
— Vraiment, et quelques chiffres vous le prouveront sans peine.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ned Land 28
— Oh ! les chiffres ! répliqua Ned. On fait ce qu’on veut avec les chiffres !
— En affaires, Ned, mais non en mathématiques. Écoutez−moi. Admettons
que la pression d’une atmosphère soit représentée par la pression d’une
colonne d’eau haute de trente−deux pieds. En réalité, la colonne d’eau
serait d’une moindre hauteur, puisqu’il s’agit de l’eau de mer dont la
densité est supérieure à celle de l’eau douce. Eh bien, quand vous plongez,
Ned, autant de fois trente−deux pieds d’eau au−dessus de vous, autant de
fois votre corps supporte une pression égale à celle de l’atmosphère,
c’est−à−dire de kilogrammes par chaque centimètre carré de sa surface. Il
suit de là qu’à trois cent vingt pieds cette pression est de dix atmosphères,
de cent atmosphères à trois mille deux cents pieds, et de mille atmosphères
à trente−deux mille pieds, soit deux lieues et demie environ. Ce qui
équivaut à dire que si vous pouviez atteindre cette profondeur dans
l’Océan, chaque centimètre carré de la surface de votre corps subirait une
pression de mille kilogrammes. Or, mon brave Ned, savez−vous ce que
vous avez de centimètres carrés en surface ?
— Je ne m’en doute pas, monsieur Aronnax.
— Environ dix−sept mille.
— Tant que cela ?
— Et comme en réalité la pression atmosphérique est un peu supérieure au
poids d’un kilogramme par centimètre carré, vos dix−sept mille
centimètres carrés supportent en ce moment une pression de dix−sept mille
cinq cent soixante−huit kilogrammes.
— Sans que je m’en aperçoive ?
— Sans que vous vous en aperceviez. Et si vous n’êtes pas écrasé par une
telle pression, c’est que l’air pénètre à l’intérieur de votre corps avec une
pression égale. De là un équilibre parfait entre la poussée intérieure et la
poussée extérieure, qui se neutralisent, ce qui vous permet de les supporter
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ned Land 29
sans peine. Mais dans l’eau, c’est autre chose.
— Oui, je comprends, répondit Ned, devenu plus attentif, parce que l’eau
m’entoure et ne me pénètre pas.
— Précisément, Ned. Ainsi donc, à trente−deux pieds au−dessous de la
surface de la mer, vous subiriez une pression de dix−sept mille cinq cent
soixante−huit kilogrammes ; à trois cent vingt pieds, dix fois cette
pression, soit cent soixante−quinze mille six cent quatre−vingt
kilogrammes ; à trois mille deux cents pieds, cent fois cette pression, soit
dix−sept cent cinquante−six mille huit cent kilogrammes ; à trente−deux
mille pieds, enfin, mille fois cette pression, soit dix−sept millions cinq cent
soixante−huit mille kilogrammes ; c’est−à−dire que vous seriez aplati
comme si l’on vous retirait des plateaux d’une machine hydraulique !
— Diable ! fit Ned.
— Eh bien, mon digne harponneur, si des vertébrés, longs de plusieurs
centaines de mètres et gros à proportion, se maintiennent à de pareilles
profondeurs, eux dont la surface est représentée par des millions de
centimètres carrés, c’est par milliards de kilogrammes qu’il faut estimer la
poussée qu’ils subissent. Calculez alors quelle doit être la résistance de
leur charpente osseuse et la puissance de leur organisme pour résister à de
telles pressions !
— Il faut, répondit Ned Land, qu’ils soient fabriqués en plaques de tôle de
huit pouces, comme les frégates cuirassées.
— Comme vous dites, Ned, et songez alors aux ravages que peut produire
une pareille masse lancée avec la vitesse d’un express contre la coque d’un
navire.
— Oui... en effet... peut−être, répondit le Canadien, ébranlé par ces
chiffres, mais qui ne voulait pas se rendre.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ned Land 30
— Eh bien, vous ai−je convaincu ?
— Vous m’avez convaincu d’une chose, monsieur le naturaliste, c’est que
si de tels animaux existent au fond des mers, il faut nécessairement qu’ils
soient aussi forts que vous le dites.
— Mais s’ils n’existent pas, entêté harponneur, comment expliquez−vous
l’accident arrivé au Scotia ?
— C’est peut−être..., dit Ned hésitant.
— Allez donc !
— Parce que... ça n’est pas vrai ! » répondit le Canadien, en reproduisant
sans le savoir une célèbre réponse d’Arago.
Mais cette réponse prouvait l’obstination du harponneur et pas autre chose.
Ce jour−là, je ne le poussai pas davantage. L’accident du Scotia n’était pas
niable. Le trou existait si bien qu’il avait fallu le boucher, et je ne pense
pas que l’existence du trou puisse se démontrer plus catégoriquement. Or,
ce trou ne s’était pas fait tout seul, et puisqu’il n’avait pas été produit par
des roches sous−marines ou des engins sous−marins, il était
nécessairement dû à l’outil perforant d’un animal.
Or, suivant moi, et toutes les raisons précédemment déduites, cet animal
appartenait à l’embranchement des vertébrés, à la classe des mammifères,
au groupe des pisciformes, et finalement à l’ordre des cétacés. Quant à la
famille dans laquelle il prenait rang, baleine, cachalot ou dauphin, quant au
genre dont il faisait partie, quant à l’espèce dans laquelle il convenait de le
ranger, c’était une question à élucider ultérieurement. Pour la résoudre. il
fallait disséquer ce monstre inconnu, pour le disséquer le prendre, pour le
prendre le harponner — ce qui était l’affaire de Ned Land — pour le
harponner le voir ce qui était l’affaire de l’équipage — et pour le voir le
rencontrer — ce qui était l’affaire du hasard.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ned Land 31
À l'aventure !
Le voyage de l’Abraham−Lincoln, pendant quelque temps, ne fut marqué
par aucun incident. Cependant une circonstance se présenta, qui mit en
relief la merveilleuse habileté de Ned Land, et montra quelle confiance on
devait avoir en lui.
Au large des Malouines, le 30 juin, la frégate communiqua avec des
baleiniers américains, et nous apprîmes qu’ils n’avaient eu aucune
connaissance du narwal. Mais l’un d’eux, le capitaine du Monroe, sachant
que Ned Land était embarqué à bord de l’Abraham−Lincoln, demanda son
aide pour chasser une baleine qui était en vue. Le commandant Farragut,
désireux de voir Ned Land à l’oeuvre, l’autorisa à se rendre à bord du
Monroe. Et le hasard servit si bien notre Canadien, qu’au lieu d’une
baleine, il en harponna deux d’un coup double, frappant l’une droit au
coeur, et s’emparant de l’autre après une poursuite de quelques minutes !
Décidément, si le monstre a jamais affaire au harpon de Ned Land, je ne
parierai pas pour le monstre.
La frégate prolongea la côte sud−est de l’Amérique avec une rapidité
prodigieuse. Le 3 juillet, nous étions à l’ouvert du détroit de Magellan, à la
hauteur du cap des Vierges. Mais le commandant Farragut ne voulut pas
prendre ce sinueux passage, et manoeuvra de manière à doubler le cap
Horn.
L’équipage lui donna raison à l’unanimité. Et en effet, était−il probable
que l’on pût rencontrer le narwal dans ce détroit resserré ? Bon nombre de
matelots affirmaient que le monstre n’y pouvait passer, « qu’il était trop
gros pour cela ! »
Le 6 juillet, vers trois heures du soir, I’Abraham Lincoln, à quinze milles
dans le sud, doubla cet îlot solitaire, ce roc perdu à l’extrémité du continent
À l'aventure ! 32
américain, auquel des marins hollandais imposèrent le nom de leur villa
natale, le cap Horn. La route fut donnée vers le nord−ouest, et le
lendemain, l’hélice de la frégate battit enfin les eaux du Pacifique.
« Ouvre l’oeil ! ouvre l’oeil ! » répétaient les matelots de l’Abraham
Lincoln.
Et ils l’ouvraient démesurément. Les yeux et les lunettes, un peu éblouis, il
est vrai, par la perspective de deux mille dollars, ne restèrent pas un instant
au repos. Jour et nuit, on observait la surface de l’Océan, et les nyctalopes,
dont la faculté de voir dans l’obscurité accroissait les chances de cinquante
pour cent, avaient beau jeu pour gagner la prime.
Moi, que l’appât de l’argent n’attirait guère, je n’étais pourtant pas le
moins attentif du bord. Ne donnant que quelques minutes au repas,
quelques heures au sommeil, indifférent au soleil ou à la pluie, je ne
quittais plus le pont du navire. Tantôt penché sur les bastingages du
gaillard d’avant, tantôt appuyé à la lisse de l’arrière, je dévorais d’un oeil
avide le cotonneux sillage qui blanchissait la mer jusqu’à perte de vue ! Et
que de fois j’ai partagé l’émotion de l’état−major, de l’équipage, lorsque
quelque capricieuse baleine élevait son dos noirâtre au−dessus des flots. Le
pont de la frégate se peuplait en un instant. Les capots vomissaient un
torrent de matelots et d’officiers. Chacun, la poitrine haletante, l’oeil
trouble, observait la marche du cétacé. Je regardais, je regardais à en user
ma rétine, à en devenir aveugle, tandis que Conseil, toujours phlegmatique,
me répétait d’un ton calme :
« Si monsieur voulait avoir la bonté de moins écarquiller ses yeux,
monsieur verrait bien davantage ! »
Mais, vaine émotion ! L’Abraham−Lincoln modifiait sa route, courait sur
l’animal signalé, simple baleine ou cachalot vulgaire, qui disparaissait
bientôt au milieu d’un concert d’imprécations !
Cependant, le temps restait favorable. Le voyage s’accomplissait dans les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À l'aventure ! 33
meilleures conditions. C’était alors la mauvaise saison australe, car le
juillet de cette zone correspond à notre janvier d’Europe ; mais la mer se
maintenait belle, et se laissait facilement observer dans un vaste périmètre.
Ned Land montrait toujours la plus tenace incrédulité ; il affectait même de
ne point examiner la surface des flots en dehors de son temps de bordée —
du moins quand aucune
baleine n’était en vue. Et pourtant sa merveilleuse puissance de vision
aurait rendu de grands services. Mais, huit heures sur douze, cet entêté
Canadien lisait ou dormait dans sa cabine. Cent fois, je lui reprochai son
indifférence.
« Bah ! répondait−il, il n’y a rien, monsieur Aronnax, et y eût−il quelque
animal, quelle chance avons−nous de l’apercevoir ? Est−ce que nous ne
courons pas à l’aventure ? On a revu, dit−on, cette bête introuvable dans
les hautes mers du Pacifique, je veux bien l’admettre, mais deux mois déjà
se sont écoulés depuis cette rencontre, et à s’en rapporter au tempérament
de votre narwal, il n’aime point à moisir longtemps dans les mêmes
parages ! Il est doué d’une prodigieuse facilité de déplacement. Or, vous le
savez mieux que moi, monsieur le professeur, la nature ne fait rien à contre
sens, et elle ne donnerait pas à un animal lent de sa nature la faculté de se
mouvoir rapidement, s’il n’avait pas besoin de s’en servir. Donc, si la bête
existe, elle est déjà loin ! »
A cela, je ne savais que répondre. Évidemment, nous marchions en
aveugles. Mais le moyen de procéder autrement ? Aussi, nos chances
étaient−elles fort limitées. Cependant, personne ne doutait encore du
succès, et pas un matelot du bord n’eût parié contre le narwal et contre sa
prochaine apparition.
Le 20 juillet, le tropique du Capricorne fut coupé par 105° de longitude, et
le 27 du même mois, nous franchissions l’équateur sur le cent dixième
méridien. Ce relèvement fait, la frégate prit une direction plus décidée vers
l’ouest, et s’engagea dans les mers centrales du Pacifique.
Le commandant Farragut pensait, avec raison, qu’il valait mieux
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À l'aventure ! 34
fréquenter les eaux profondes, et s’éloigner des continents ou des îles dont
l’animal avait toujours paru éviter l’approche, « sans doute parce qu’il n’y
avait pas assez d’eau pour lui ! » disait le maître d’équipage. La frégate
passa donc au large des Pomotou, des Marquises, des Sandwich, coupa le
tropique du Cancer par 132° de longitude, et se dirigea vers les mers de
Chine.
Nous étions enfin sur le théâtre des derniers ébats du monstre ! Et, pour
tout dire, on ne vivait plus à bord. Les coeurs palpitaient effroyablement, et
se préparaient pour l’avenir d’incurables anévrismes. L’équipage entier
subissait une surexcitation nerveuse, dont je ne saurais donner l’idée. On
ne mangeait pas, on ne dormait plus. Vingt fois par jour, une erreur
d’appréciation, une illusion d’optique de quelque matelot perché sur les
barres, causaient d’intolérables douleurs, et ces émotions, vingt fois
répétées, nous maintenaient dans un état d’éréthisme trop violent pour ne
pas amener une réaction prochaine.
Et en effet, la réaction ne tarda pas à se produire. Pendant trois mois, trois
mois dont chaque jour durait un siècle ! L’Abraham−Lincoln sillonna
toutes les mers septentrionales du Pacifique, courant aux baleines
signalées, faisant de brusques écarts de route, virant subitement d’un bord
sur l’autre, s’arrêtant soudain, forçant ou renversant sa vapeur, coup sur
coup, au risque de déniveler sa machine, et il ne laissa pas un point
inexploré des rivages du Japon à la côte américaine. Et rien ! rien que
l’immensité des flots déserts ! Rien qui ressemblât à un narwal
gigantesque, ni à un îlot sous−marin, ni à une épave de naufrage, ni à un
écueil fuyant, ni à quoi que ce fût de surnaturel !
La réaction se fit donc. Le découragement s’empara d’abord des esprits, et
ouvrit une brèche à l’incrédulité. Un nouveau sentiment se produisit à
bord, qui se composait de trois dixièmes de honte contre sept dixièmes de
fureur. On était « tout bête » de s’être laissé prendre à une chimère, mais
encore plus furieux ! Les montagnes d’arguments entassés depuis un an
s’écroulèrent à la fois, et chacun ne songea plus qu’à se rattraper aux
heures de repas ou de sommeil du temps qu’il avait si sottement sacrifié.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À l'aventure ! 35
Avec la mobilité naturelle à l’esprit humain, d’un excès on se jeta dans un
autre. Les plus chauds partisans de l’entreprise devinrent fatalement ses
plus ardents détracteurs. La réaction monta des fonds du navire, du poste
des soutiers jusqu’au carré de l’état−major, et certainement, sans un
entêtement très particulier du commandant Farragut, la frégate eût
définitivement remis le cap au sud.
Cependant, cette recherche inutile ne pouvait se prolonger plus longtemps.
L’Abraham−Lincoln n’avait rien à se reprocher, ayant tout fait pour
réussir. Jamais équipage d’un bâtiment de la marine américaine ne montra
plus de patience et plus de zèle ; son insuccès ne saurait lui être imputé ; il
ne restait plus qu’à revenir.
Une représentation dans ce sens fut faite au commandant. Le commandant
tint bon. Les matelots ne cachèrent point leur mécontentement, et le
service en souffrit. Je ne veux pas dire qu’il y eut révolte à bord, mais
après une raisonnable période d’obstination, le commandant Farragut
comme autrefois Colomb, demanda trois jours de patience. Si dans le délai
de trois jours, le monstre n’avait pas paru, l’homme de barre donnerait
trois tours de roue, et l’Abraham−Lincoln ferait route vers les mers
européennes.
Cette promesse fut faite le 2 novembre. Elle eut tout d’abord pour résultat
de ranimer les défaillances de l’équipage. L’Océan fut observé avec une
nouvelle attention. Chacun voulait lui jeter ce dernier coup d’oeil dans
lequel se résume tout le souvenir. Les lunettes fonctionnèrent avec une
activité fiévreuse. C’était un suprême défi porté au narwal géant, et
celui−ci ne pouvait raisonnablement se dispenser de répondre à cette
sommation « à comparaître ! »
Deux jours se passèrent. L’Abraham−Lincoln se tenait sous petite vapeur.
On employait mille moyens pour éveiller l’attention ou stimuler l’apathie
de l’animal, au cas où il se fût rencontré dans ces parages. D’énormes
quartiers de lard furent mis à la traîne pour la plus grande satisfaction des
requins, je dois le dire. Les embarcations rayonnèrent dans toutes les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À l'aventure ! 36
directions autour de l’Abraham−Lincoln, pendant qu’il mettait en panne, et
ne laissèrent pas un point de mer inexploré. Mais le soir du 4 novembre
arriva sans que se fût dévoilé ce mystère sous−marin.
Le lendemain, 5 novembre, à midi, expirait le délai de rigueur. Après le
point, le commandant Farragut, fidèle à sa promesse, devait donner la route
au sud−est, et abandonner définitivement les régions septentrionales du
Pacifique.
La frégate se trouvait alors par 31°15’de latitude nord et par 136°42’de
longitude est. Les terres du Japon nous restaient à moins de deux cents
milles sous le vent. La nuit approchait.
On venait de piquer huit heures. De gros nuages voilaient le disque de la
lune, alors dans son premier quartier. La mer ondulait paisiblement sous
l’étrave de la frégate.
En ce moment, j’étais appuyé à l’avant, sur le bastingage de tribord.
Conseil, posté près de moi, regardait devant lui. L’équipage, juché dans les
haubans, examinait l’horizon qui se rétrécissait et s’obscurcissait peu à
peu. Les officiers, armes de leur lorgnette de nuit, fouillaient l’obscurité
croissante. Parfois le sombre Océan étincelait sous un rayon que la lune
dardait entre la frange de deux nuages. Puis, toute trace lumineuse
s’évanouissait dans les ténèbres.
En observant Conseil, je constatai que ce brave garçon subissait tant soit
peu l’influence générale. Du moins, je le crus ainsi. Peut−être, et pour la
première fois, ses nerfs vibraient−ils sous l’action d’un sentiment de
curiosité.
« Allons, Conseil, lui dis−je, voilà une dernière occasion d’empocher deux
mille dollars.
— Que monsieur me permette de le lui dire, répondit Conseil, je n’ai
jamais compté sur cette prime, et le gouvernement de l’Union pouvait
promettre cent mille dollars, il n’en aurait pas été plus pauvre.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À l'aventure ! 37
— Tu as raison, Conseil. C’est une sotte affaire, après tout, et dans laquelle
nous nous sommes lancés trop légèrement. Que de temps perdu, que
d’émotions inutiles ! Depuis six mois déjà, nous serions rentrés en
France...
— Dans le petit appartement de monsieur, répliqua Conseil, dans le
Muséum de monsieur ! Et j’aurais déjà classé les fossiles de monsieur ! Et
le babiroussa de monsieur serait installé dans sa cage du Jardin des Plantes,
et il attirerait tous les curieux de la capitale !
— Comme tu dis, Conseil, et sans compter, j’imagine, que l’on se moquera
de nous !
— Effectivement, répondit tranquillement Conseil, je pense que l’on se
moquera de monsieur. Et, faut−il le dire... ?
— Il faut le dire, Conseil.
— Eh bien, monsieur n’aura que ce qu’il mérite !
— Vraiment !
— Quand on a l’honneur d’être un savant comme monsieur, on ne
s’expose pas... »
Conseil ne put achever son compliment. Au milieu du silence général, une
voix venait de se faire entendre. C’était la voix de Ned Land, et Ned Land
s’écriait :
« Ohé ! la chose en question, sous le vent, par le travers à nous ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À l'aventure ! 38
À toute vapeur
A ce cri, l’équipage entier se précipita vers le harponneur, commandant,
officiers, maîtres, matelots, mousses, jusqu’aux ingénieurs qui quittèrent
leur machine, jusqu’aux chauffeurs qui abandonnèrent leurs fourneaux.
L’ordre de stopper avait été donné, et la frégate ne courait plus que sur son
erre.
L’obscurité était profonde alors, et quelques bons que fussent les yeux du
Canadien, je me demandais comment il avait vu et ce qu’il avait pu voir.
Mon coeur battait à se rompre.
Mais Ned Land ne s’était pas trompé, et tous, nous aperçûmes l’objet qu’il
indiquait de la main.
A deux encablures de l’Abraham−Lincoln et de sa hanche de tribord, la
mer semblait être illuminée par dessus. Ce n’était point un simple
phénomène de phosphorescence, et l’on ne pouvait s’y tromper. Le
monstre, immergé à quelques toises de la surface des eaux, projetait cet
éclat très intense, mais inexplicable, que mentionnaient les rapports de
plusieurs capitaines. Cette magnifique irradiation devait être produite par
un agent d’une grande puissance éclairante. La partie lumineuse décrivait
sur la mer un immense ovale très allongé, au centre duquel se condensait
un foyer ardent dont l’insoutenable éclat s’éteignait par dégradations
successives.
« Ce n’est qu’une agglomération de molécules phosphorescentes, s’écria
l’un des officiers.
— Non, monsieur, répliquai−je avec conviction. Jamais les pholades ou les
salpes ne produisent une si puissante lumière. Cet éclat est de nature
essentiellement électrique... D’ailleurs, voyez, voyez ! il se déplace ! il se
meut en avant, en arrière ! il s’élance sur nous ! »
À toute vapeur 39
Un cri général s’éleva de la frégate.
« Silence ! dit le commandant Farragut. La barre au vent, toute ! Machine
en arrière ! »
Les matelots se précipitèrent à la barre, les ingénieurs à leur machine. La
vapeur fut immédiatement renversée et l’Abraham−Lincoln, abattant sur
bâbord, décrivit un demi−cercle.
« La barre droite ! Machine en avant ! » cria le commandant Farragut.
Ces ordres furent exécutés, et la frégate s’éloigna rapidement du foyer
lumineux.
Je me trompe. Elle voulut s’éloigner, mais le surnaturel animal se
rapprocha avec une vitesse double de la sienne.
Nous étions haletants. La stupéfaction, bien plus que la crainte nous tenait
muets et immobiles. L’animal nous gagnait en se jouant. Il fit le tour de la
frégate qui filait alors quatorze noeuds. et l’enveloppa de ses nappes
électriques comme d’une poussière lumineuse. Puis il s’éloigna de deux ou
trois milles, laissant une traînée phosphorescente comparable aux
tourbillons de vapeur que jette en arrière la locomotive d’un express. Tout
d’un coup. des obscures limites de l’horizon, où il alla prendre son élan, le
monstre fonça subitement vers l’Abraham−Lincoln avec une effrayante
rapidité, s’arrêta brusquement à vingt pieds de ses précintes, s’éteignit non
pas en s’abîmant sous les eaux, puisque son éclat ne subit aucune
dégradation mais soudainement et comme si la source de ce brillant effluve
se fût subitement tarie ! Puis, il reparut de l’autre côté du navire, soit qu’il
l’eût tourné, soit qu’il eût glissé sous sa coque. A chaque instant une
collision pouvait se produire, qui nous eût été fatale.
Cependant, je m’étonnais des manoeuvres de la frégate. Elle fuyait et
n’attaquait pas. Elle était poursuivie, elle qui devait poursuivre, et j’en fis
l’observation au commandant Farragut. Sa figure, d’ordinaire si
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 40
impassible, était empreinte d’un indéfinissable étonnement.
« Monsieur Aronnax, me répondit−il, je ne sais à quel être formidable j’ai
affaire, et je ne veux pas risquer imprudemment ma frégate au milieu de
cette obscurité. D’ailleurs, comment attaquer l’inconnu, comment s’en
défendre ? Attendons le jour et les rôles changeront.
— Vous n’avez plus de doute, commandant, sur la nature de l’animal ?
— Non, monsieur, c’est évidemment un narwal gigantesque, mais aussi un
narwal électrique.
— Peut−être, ajoutai−je, ne peut−on pas plus l’approcher qu’une gymnote
ou une torpille !
— En effet, répondit le commandant, et s’il possède en lui une puissance
foudroyante, c’est à coup sûr le plus terrible animal qui soit jamais sorti de
la main du Créateur. C’est pourquoi, monsieur, je me tiendrai sur mes
gardes. »
Tout l’équipage resta sur pied pendant la nuit. Personne ne songea à
dormir. L’Abraham−Lincoln, ne pouvant lutter de vitesse, avait modéré sa
marche et se tenait sous petite vapeur. De son côté, le narwal, imitant la
frégate, se laissait bercer au gré des lames, et semblait décidé à ne point
abandonner le théâtre de la lutte.
Vers minuit, cependant, il disparut, ou, pour employer une expression plus
juste, il « s’éteignit » comme un gros ver luisant. Avait−il fui ? Il fallait le
craindre, non pas l’espérer. Mais à une heure moins sept minutes du matin,
un sifflement assourdissant se fit entendre, semblable à celui que produit
une colonne d’eau, chassée avec une extrême violence.
Le commandant Farragut, Ned Land et moi, nous étions alors sur la
dunette, jetant d’avides regards à travers les profondes ténèbres.
« Ned Land, demanda le commandant, vous avez souvent entendu rugir
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 41
des baleines ?
— Souvent, monsieur, mais jamais de pareilles baleines dont la vue m’ait
rapporté deux mille dollars.
— En effet, vous avez droit à la prime. Mais, dites−moi, ce bruit n’est−il
pas celui que font les cétacés rejetant l’eau par leurs évents ?
— Le même bruit, monsieur, mais celui−ci est incomparablement plus fort.
Aussi, ne peut−on s’y tromper. C’est bien un cétacé qui se tient là dans nos
eaux. Avec votre permission, monsieur, ajouta le harponneur, nous lui
dirons deux mots demain au lever du jour.
— S’il est d’humeur à vous entendre, maître Land, répondis−je d’un ton
peu convaincu.
— Que je l’approche à quatre longueurs de harpon, riposta le Canadien, et
il faudra bien qu’il m’écoute !
— Mais pour l’approcher, reprit le commandant, je devrai mettre une
baleinière à votre disposition ?
— Sans doute, monsieur.
— Ce sera jouer la vie de mes hommes ?
— Et la mienne ! » répondit simplement le harponneur.
Vers deux heures du matin le foyer lumineux reparut, non moins intense, à
cinq milles au vent de l’Abraham−Lincoln. Malgré la distance, malgré le
bruit du vent et de la mer, on entendait distinctement les formidables
battements de queue de l’animal et jusqu’à sa respiration haletante. Il
semblait qu’au moment où l’énorme narwal venait respirer à la surface de
l’océan, l’air s’engouffrait dans ses poumons, comme fait la vapeur dans
les vastes cylindres d’une machine de deux mille chevaux.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 42
« Hum ! pensai−je, une baleine qui aurait la force d’un régiment de
cavalerie, ce serait une jolie baleine ! »
On resta sur le qui−vive jusqu’au jour, et l’on se prépara au combat. Les
engins de pêche furent disposés le long des bastingages. Le second fit
charger ces espingoles qui lancent un harpon à une distance d’un mille, et
de longues canardières à balles explosives dont la blessure est mortelle,
même aux plus puissants animaux. Ned Land s’était contenté d’affûter son
harpon, arme terrible dans sa main.
A six heures, l’aube commença à poindre, et avec les premières lueurs de
l’aurore disparut l’éclat électrique du narwal. A sept heures, le jour était
suffisamment fait, mais une brume matinale très épaisse rétrécissait
l’horizon, et les meilleures lorgnettes ne pouvaient la percer. De là,
désappointement et colère.
Je me hissai jusqu’aux barres d’artimon. Quelques officiers s’étaient déjà
perchés à la tête des mâts.
A huit heures, la brume roula lourdement sur les flots, et ses grosses
volutes se levèrent peu à peu. L’horizon s’élargissait et se purifiait à la
fois.
Soudain, et comme la veille, la voix de Ned Land se fit entendre.
« La chose en question, par bâbord derrière ! » cria le harponneur.
Tous les regards se dirigèrent vers le point indiqué.
Là, à un mille et demi de la frégate, un long corps noirâtre émergeait d’un
mètre au−dessus des flots. Sa queue, violemment agitée, produisait un
remous considérable. Jamais appareil caudal ne battit la mer avec une telle
puissance. Un immense sillage, d’une blancheur éclatante, marquait le
passage de l’animal et décrivait une courbe allongée.
La frégate s’approcha du cétacé. Je l’examinai en toute liberté d’esprit. Les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 43
rapports du Shannon et de l’Helvetia avaient un peu exagéré ses
dimensions, et j’estimai sa longueur à deux cent cinquante pieds
seulement. Quant à sa grosseur, je ne pouvais que difficilement
l’apprécier ; mais, en somme, l’animal me parut être admirablement
proportionné dans ses trois dimensions.
Pendant que j’observais cet être phénoménal, deux jets de vapeur et d’eau
s’élancèrent de ses évents, et montèrent à une hauteur de quarante mètres,
ce qui me fixa sur son mode de respiration. J’en conclus définitivement
qu’il appartenait à l’embranchement des vertébrés, classe des mammifères,
sous−classe des monodelphiens, groupe des pisciformes, ordre des cétacés,
famille... Ici, je ne pouvais encore me prononcer. L’ordre des cétacés
comprend trois familles : les baleines, les cachalots et les dauphins, et c’est
dans cette dernière que sont rangés les narwals. Chacune de ces famille se
divise en plusieurs genres, chaque genre en espèces, chaque espèce en
variétés. Variété, espèce, genre et famille me manquaient encore, mais je
ne doutais pas de compléter ma classification avec l’aide du ciel et du
commandant Farragut.
L’équipage attendait impatiemment les ordres de son chef. Celui−ci, après
avoir attentivement observé l’animal, fit appeler l’ingénieur. L’ingénieur
accourut.
« Monsieur, dit le commandant, vous avez de la pression ?
— Oui, monsieur, répondit l’ingénieur.
— Bien. Forcez vos feux, et à toute vapeur ! »
Trois hurrahs accueillirent cet ordre. L’heure de la lutte avait sonné.
Quelques instants après, les deux cheminées de la frégate vomissaient des
torrents de fumée noire, et le pont frémissait sous le tremblotement des
chaudières.
L’Abraham−Lincoln, chassé en avant par sa puissante hélice, se dirigea
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 44
droit sur l’animal. Celui−ci le laissa indifféremment s’approcher à une
demi−encablure ; puis dédaignant de plonger, il prit une petite allure de
fuite, et se contenta de maintenir sa distance.
Cette poursuite se prolongea pendant trois quarts d’heure environ, sans que
la frégate gagnât deux toises sur le cétacé Il était donc évident qu’à
marcher ainsi, on ne l’atteindrait jamais.
Le commandant Farragut tordait avec rage l’épaisse touffe de poils qui
foisonnait sous son menton.
« Ned Land ? » cria−t−il.
Le Canadien vint à l’ordre.
« Eh bien, maître Land, demanda le commandant, me conseillez−vous
encore de mettre mes embarcations à la mer ?
— Non, monsieur, répondit Ned Land, car cette bête−là ne se laissera
prendre que si elle le veut bien.
— Que faire alors ?
— Forcer de vapeur si vous le pouvez, monsieur. Pour moi, avec votre
permission, s’entend, je vais m’installer sous les sous−barbes de beaupré,
et si nous arrivons à longueur de harpon, je harponne.
— Allez, Ned, répondit le commandant Farragut. Ingénieur, cria−t−il,
faites monter la pression. »
Ned Land se rendit à son poste. Les feux furent plus activement poussés ;
l’hélice donna quarante−trois tours à la minute, et la vapeur fusa par les
soupapes. Le loch jeté, on constata que l’Abraham−Lincoln marchait à
raison de dix−huit milles cinq dixièmes à l’heure.
Mais le maudit animal filait aussi avec une vitesse de dix−huit milles cinq
dixièmes.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 45
Pendant une heure encore, la frégate se maintint sous cette allure, sans
gagner une toise ! C’était humiliant pour l’un des plus rapides marcheurs
de la marine américaine. Une sourde colère courait parmi l’équipage. Les
matelots injuriaient le monstre, qui, d’ailleurs, dédaignait de leur répondre.
Le commandant Farragut ne se contentait plus de tordre sa barbiche, il la
mordait.
L’ingénieur fut encore une fois appelé.
« Vous avez atteint votre maximum de pression ? Lui demanda le
commandant.
— Oui, monsieur, répondit l’ingénieur.
— Et vos soupapes sont chargées ? ...
— A six atmosphères et demie.
— Chargez−les à dix atmosphères. »
Voilà un ordre américain s’il en fut. On n’eût pas mieux fait sur le
Mississippi pour distancer une « concurrence » !
« Conseil, dis−je à mon brave serviteur qui se trouvait près de moi, sais−tu
bien que nous allons probablement sauter ?
— Comme il plaira à monsieur ! » répondit Conseil.
Eh bien ! je l’avouerai, cette chance, il ne me déplaisait pas de la risquer.
Les soupapes furent chargées. Le charbon s’engouffra dans les fourneaux.
Les ventilateurs envoyèrent des torrents d’air sur les brasiers. La rapidité
de l’Abraham Lincoln s’accrut. Ses mâts tremblaient jusque dans leurs
emplantures, et les tourbillons de fumée pouvaient à peine trouver passage
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 46
par les cheminées trop étroites.
On jeta le loch une seconde fois.
« Eh bien ! timonier ? demanda le commandant Farragut.
— Dix neuf milles trois dixièmes, monsieur.
— Forcez les feux. »
L’ingénieur obéit. Le manomètre marqua dix atmosphères. Mais le cétacé
« chauffa » lui aussi, sans doute, car, sans se gêner, il fila ses dix−neuf
milles et trois dixièmes.
Quelle poursuite ! Non, je ne puis décrire l’émotion qui faisait vibrer tout
mon être. Ned Land se tenait à son poste, le harpon à la main. Plusieurs
fois, l’animal se laissa approcher.
« Nous le gagnons ! nous le gagnons ! » s’écria le Canadien.
Puis, au moment où il se disposait à frapper, le cétacé se dérobait avec une
rapidité que je ne puis estimer à moins de trente milles à l’heure. Et même,
pendant notre maximum de vitesse, ne se permit−il pas de narguer la
frégate en en faisant le tour ! Un cri de fureur s’échappa de toutes les
poitrines !
A midi, nous n’étions pas plus avancés qu’à huit heures du matin.
Le commandant Farragut se décida alors à employer des moyens plus
directs.
« Ah ! dit−il, cet animal−là va plus vite que l’Abraham−Lincoln ! Eh
bien : nous allons voir s’il distancera ses boulets coniques. Maître, des
hommes à la pièce de l’avant. »
Le canon de gaillard fut immédiatement chargé et braqué. Le coup partit,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 47
mais le boulet passa à quelques pieds au−dessus du cétacé, qui se tenait à
un demi−mille.
« A un autre plus adroit ! cria le commandant, et cinq cents dollars à qui
percera cette infernale bête ! »
Un vieux canonnier à barbe grise – que je vois encore −, l’oeil calme, la
physionomie froide, s’approcha de sa pièce, la mit en position et visa
longtemps. Une forte détonation éclata, à laquelle se mêlèrent les hurrahs
de l’équipage.
Le boulet atteignit son but, il frappa l’animal, mais non pas normalement,
et glissant sur sa surface arrondie, il alla se perdre à deux milles en mer.
« Ah ça ! dit le vieux canonnier, rageant, ce gueux−là est donc blindé avec
des plaques de six pouces !
— Malédiction ! » s’écria le commandant Farragut.
La chasse recommença, et le commandant Farragut se penchant vers moi,
me dit :
« Je poursuivrai l’animal jusqu’à ce que ma frégate éclate !
— Oui, répondis−je, et vous aurez raison ! »
On pouvait espérer que l’animal s’épuiserait, et qu’il ne serait pas
indifférent à la fatigue comme une machine à vapeur. Mais il n’en fut rien.
Les heures s’écoulèrent, sans qu’il donnât aucun signe d’épuisement.
Cependant, il faut dire à la louange de l’Abraham−Lincoln qu’il lutta avec
une infatigable ténacité. Je n’estime pas à moins de cinq cents kilomètres
la distance qu’il parcourut pendant cette malencontreuse journée du 6
novembre ! Mais la nuit vint et enveloppa de ses ombres le houleux océan.
En ce moment, je crus que notre expédition était terminée, et que nous ne
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 48
reverrions plus jamais le fantastique animal. Je me trompais.
A dix heures cinquante minutes du soir, la clarté électrique réapparut, à
trois milles au vent de la frégate, aussi pure, aussi intense que pendant la
nuit dernière.
Le narwal semblait immobile. Peut−être, fatigué de sa journée, dormait−il,
se laissant aller à l’ondulation des lames ? Il y avait là une chance dont le
commandant Farragut résolut de profiter.
Il donna ses ordres. L’Abraham−Lincoln fut tenu sous petite vapeur, et
s’avança prudemment pour ne pas éveiller son adversaire. Il n’est pas rare
de rencontrer en plein océan des baleines profondément endormies que
l’on attaque alors avec succès, et Ned Land en avait harponné plus d’une
pendant son sommeil. Le Canadien alla reprendre son poste dans les
sous−barbes du beaupré.
La frégate s’approcha sans bruit, stoppa à deux encablures de l’animal, et
courut sur son erre. On ne respirait plus à bord. Un silence profond régnait
sur le pont. Nous n’étions pas à cent pieds du foyer ardent, dont l’éclat
grandissait et éblouissait nos yeux.
En ce moment, penché sur la lisse du gaillard d’avant je voyais au−dessous
de moi Ned Land, accroché d’une main à la martingale, de l’autre
brandissant son terrible harpon Vingt pieds à peine le séparaient de
l’animal immobile.
Tout d’un coup, son bras se détendit violemment, et le harpon fut lancé.
J’entendis le choc sonore de l’arme, qui semblait avoir heurté un corps dur.
La clarté électrique s’éteignit soudain, et deux énormes trombes d’eau
s’abattirent sur le pont de la frégate, courant comme un torrent de l’avant à
l’arrière, renversant les hommes, brisant les saisines des dromes.
Un choc effroyable se produisit, et, lancé par−dessus la lisse, sans avoir le
temps de me retenir, je fus précipité à la mer.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
À toute vapeur 49
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue
Bien que j’eusse été surpris par cette chute inattendue, je n’en conservai
pas moins une impression très nette de mes sensations.
Je fus d’abord entraîné à une profondeur de vingt pieds environ. Je suis
bon nageur, sans prétendre égaler Byron et Edgar Poe, qui sont des
maîtres, et ce plongeon ne me fit point perdre la tête. Deux vigoureux
coups de talons me ramenèrent à la surface de la mer.
Mon premier soin fut de chercher des yeux la frégate. L’équipage s’était−il
aperçu de ma disparition ? L’Abraham−Lincoln avait−il viré de bord ? Le
commandant Farragut mettait−il une embarcation à la mer ? Devais−je
espérer d’être sauvé ?
Les ténèbres étaient profondes. J’entrevis une masse noire qui disparaissait
vers l’est, et dont les feux de position s’éteignirent dans l’éloignement.
C’était la frégate. Je me sentis perdu.
« A moi ! à moi ! » criai−je. en nageant vers l’Abraham−Lincoln d’un bras
désespéré.
Mes vêtements m’embarrassaient. L’eau les collait à mon corps, ils
paralysaient mes mouvements. Je coulais ! je suffoquais ! ...
« A moi ! »
Ce fut le dernier cri que je jetai. Ma bouche s’emplit d’eau. Je me débattis,
entraîné dans l’abîme...
Soudain, mes habits furent saisis par une main vigoureuse, je me sentis
violemment ramené à la surface de lamer, et j’entendis, oui, j’entendis ces
paroles prononcées à mon oreille :
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 50
« Si monsieur veut avoir l’extrême obligeance de s’appuyer sur mon
épaule, monsieur nagera beaucoup plus à son aise. »
Je saisis d’une main le bras de mon fidèle Conseil.
« Toi ! dis−je, toi !
— Moi−même, répondit Conseil, et aux ordres de monsieur.
— Et ce choc t’a précipité en même temps que moi à la mer ?
— Nullement. Mais étant au service de monsieur, j’ai suivi monsieur ! »
Le digne garçon trouvait cela tout naturel !
« Et la frégate ? demandai−je.
— La frégate ! répondit Conseil en se retournant sur le dos, je crois que
monsieur fera bien de ne pas trop compter sur elle !
— Tu dis ?
— Je dis qu’au moment où je me précipitai à la mer, j’entendis les
hommes de barre s’écrier : « L’hélice et le gouvernail sont brisés... »
— Brisés ?
— Oui ! brisés par la dent du monstre. C’est la seule avarie, je pense, que
l’Abraham−Lincoln ait éprouvée. Mais, circonstance fâcheuse pour nous,
il ne gouverne plus.
— Alors, nous sommes perdus !
— Peut−être, répondit tranquillement Conseil. Cependant, nous avons
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 51
encore quelques heures devant nous, et en quelques heures, on fait bien des
choses ! »
L’imperturbable sang−froid de Conseil me remonta. Je nageai plus
vigoureusement ; mais, gêné par mes vêtements qui me serraient comme
un chape de plomb, j’éprouvais une extrême difficulté à me soutenir.
Conseil s’en aperçut.
« Que monsieur me permette de lui faire une incision », dit−il.
Et glissant un couteau ouvert sous mes habits, il les fendit de haut en bas
d’un coup rapide. Puis, il m’en débarrassa lestement, tandis que je nageais
pour tous deux.
A mon tour, je rendis le même service à Conseil, et nous continuâmes de «
naviguer » l’un près de l’autre.
Cependant, la situation n’en était pas moins terrible. Peut−être notre
disparition n’avait−elle pas été remarquée, et l’eût−elle été, la frégate ne
pouvait revenir sous le vent à nous, étant démontée de son gouvernail. Il ne
fallait donc compter que sur ses embarcations.
Conseil raisonna froidement dans cette hypothèse et fit son plan en
conséquence. Étonnante nature ! Ce phlegmatique garçon était là comme
chez lui !
Il fut donc décidé que notre seule chance de salut étant d’être recueillis par
les embarcations de l’Abraham−Lincoln, nous devions nous organiser de
manière a les attendre le plus longtemps possible. Je résolus alors de
diviser nos forces afin de ne pas les épuiser simultanément, et voici ce qui
fut convenu : pendant que l’un de nous, étendu sur le dos, se tiendrait,
immobile, les bras croisés, les jambes allongées, l’autre nagerait et le
pousserait en avant. Ce rôle de remorqueur ne devait pas durer plus de dix
minutes, et nous relayant ainsi, nous pouvions surnager pendant quelques
heures, et peut−être jusqu’au lever du jour.
Faible chance ! mais l’espoir est si fortement enraciné au coeur de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 52
l’homme ! Puis, nous étions deux. Enfin je l’affirme bien que cela paraisse
improbable −, si je cherchais à détruire en moi toute illusion, si je voulais «
désespérer », je ne le pouvais pas !
La collision de la frégate et du cétacé s’était produite vers onze heures du
soir environ. Je comptais donc sur huit heures de nage jusqu’au lever du
soleil. Opération rigoureusement praticable, en nous relayant. La mer assez
belle, nous fatiguait peu. Parfois, je cherchais à percer du regard ces
épaisses ténèbres que rompait seule la phosphorescence provoquée par nos
mouvements. Je regardais ces ondes lumineuses qui se brisaient sur ma
main et dont la nappe miroitante se tachait de plaques livides. On eût dit
que nous étions plongés dans un bain de mercure.
Vers une heure du matin, je fus pris d’une extrême fatigue. Mes membres
se raidirent sous l’étreinte de crampes violentes. Conseil dut me soutenir,
et le soin de notre conservation reposa sur lui seul. J’entendis bientôt
haleter le pauvre garçon ; sa respiration devint courte et pressée. Je
compris qu’il ne pouvait résister longtemps.
« Laisse−moi ! laisse−moi ! lui dis−je.
— Abandonner monsieur ! jamais ! répondit−il. Je compte bien me noyer
avant lui ! »
En ce moment, la lune apparut à travers les franges d’un gros nuage que le
vent entraînait dans l’est. La surface de la mer étincela sous ses rayons.
Cette bienfaisante lumière ranima nos forces. Ma tête se redressa. Mes
regards se portèrent à tous les points de l’horizon. J’aperçus la frégate. Elle
était à cinq mille de nous, et ne formait plus qu’une masse sombre, à peine
appréciable ! Mais d’embarcations, point !
Je voulus crier. A quoi bon, à pareille distance ! Mes lèvres gonflées ne
laissèrent passer aucun son. Conseil put articuler quelques mots, et je
l’entendis répéter à plusieurs reprises :
« A nous ! à nous ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 53
Nos mouvements un instant suspendus, nous écoutâmes. Et, fût−ce un de
ces bourdonnements dont le sang oppressé emplit l’oreille, mais il me
sembla qu’un cri répondait au cri de Conseil.
« As−tu entendu ? murmurai−je.
— Oui ! oui ! »
Et Conseil jeta dans l’espace un nouvel appel désespéré.
Cette fois, pas d’erreur possible ! Une voix humaine répondait à la nôtre !
Était−ce la voix de quelque infortuné, abandonné au milieu de l’Océan,
quelque autre victime du choc éprouvé par le navire ? Ou plutôt une
embarcation de la frégate ne nous hélait−elle pas dans l’ombre ?
Conseil fit un suprême effort, et, s’appuyant sur mon épaule, tandis que je
résistais dans une dernière convulsion, il se dressa à demi hors de l’eau et
retomba épuisé.
« Qu’as−tu vu ?
— J’ai vu... murmura−t−il, j’ai vu... mais ne parlons pas... gardons toutes
nos forces ! ... »
Qu’avait−il vu ? Alors, je ne sais pourquoi, la pensée du monstre me vint
pour la première fois à l’esprit ! ... Mais cette voix cependant ? ... Les
temps ne sont plus où les Jonas se réfugient dans le ventre des baleines !
Pourtant, Conseil me remorquait encore. Il relevait parfois la tête, regardait
devant lui, et jetait un cri de reconnaissance auquel répondait une voix de
plus en plus rapprochée. Je l’entendais à peine. Mes forces étaient à bout ;
mes doigts s’écartaient ; ma main ne me fournissait plus un point d’appui ;
ma bouche, convulsivement ouverte, s’emplissait d’eau salée ; le froid
m’envahissait. Je relevai la tête une dernière fois, puis, je m’abîmai...
En cet instant, un corps dur me heurta. Je m’y cramponnai. Puis, je sentis
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 54
qu’on me retirait, qu’on me ramenait à la surface de l’eau, que ma poitrine
se dégonflait, et je m’évanouis...
Il est certain que je revins promptement à moi, grâce à de vigoureuses
frictions qui me sillonnèrent le corps. J’entr’ouvris les yeux...
« Conseil ! murmurai−je.
— Monsieur m’a sonné ? » répondit Conseil.
En ce moment, aux dernières clartés de la lune qui s’abaissait vers
l’horizon, j’aperçus une figure qui n’était pas celle de Conseil, et que je
reconnus aussitôt.
« Ned ! m’écriai−je
— En personne, monsieur, et qui court après sa prime ! répondit le
Canadien.
— Vous avez été précipité à la mer au choc de la frégate ?
— Oui, monsieur le professeur, mais plus favorisé que vous, j’ai pu
prendre pied presque immédiatement sur un îlot flottant.
— Un îlot ?
— Ou, pour mieux dire, sur notre narwal gigantesque.
— Expliquez−vous, Ned.
— Seulement, j’ai bientôt compris pourquoi mon harpon n’avait pu
l’entamer et s’était émoussé sur sa peau.
— Pourquoi, Ned, pourquoi ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 55
— C’est que cette bête−là, monsieur le professeur, est faite en tôle
d’acier ! »
Il faut que je reprenne mes esprits, que je revivifie mes souvenirs, que je
contrôle moi−même mes assertions.
Les dernières paroles du Canadien avaient produit un revirement subit dans
mon cerveau. Je me hissai rapidement au sommet de l’être ou de l’objet à
demi immergé qui nous servait de refuge. Je l’éprouvai du pied. C’était
évidemment un corps dur, impénétrable, et non pas cette substance molle
qui forme la masse des grands mammifères marins.
Mais ce corps dur pouvait être une carapace osseuse, semblable à celle des
animaux antédiluviens, et j’en serais quitte pour classer le monstre parmi
les reptiles amphibies, tels que les tortues ou les alligators.
Eh bien ! non ! Le dos noirâtre qui me supportait était lisse, poli, non
imbriqué. Il rendait au choc une sonorité métallique, et, si incroyable que
cela fût, il semblait que, dis−je, il était fait de plaques boulonnées.
Le doute n’était pas possible ! L’animal, le monstre, le phénomène naturel
qui avait intrigué le monde savant tout entier, bouleversé et fourvoyé
l’imagination des marins des deux hémisphères, il fallait bien le
reconnaître, c’était un phénomène plus étonnant encore, un phénomène de
main d’homme.
La découverte de l’existence de l’être le plus fabuleux, le plus
mythologique, n’eût pas, au même degré, surpris ma raison. Que ce qui est
prodigieux vienne du Créateur, c’est tout simple. Mais trouver tout à coup,
sous ses yeux, l’impossible mystérieusement et humainement réalisé,
c’était à confondre l’esprit !
Il n’y avait pas à hésiter cependant. Nous étions étendus sur le dos d’une
sorte de bateau sous−marin, qui présentait, autant que j’en pouvais juger, la
forme d’un immense poisson d’acier. L’opinion de Ned Land était faite sur
ce point. Conseil et moi, nous ne pûmes que nous y ranger.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 56
« Mais alors, dis−je, cet appareil renferme en lui un mécanisme de
locomotion et un équipage pour le manoeuvrer ?
— Évidemment, répondit le harponneur, et néanmoins, depuis trois heures
que j’habite cette île flottante, elle n’a pas donné signé de vie.
— Ce bateau n’a pas marché ?
— Non, monsieur Aronnax. Il se laisse bercer au gré des lames, mais il ne
bouge pas.
— Nous savons, à n’en pas douter, cependant, qu’il est doué d’une grande
vitesse. Or, comme il faut une machine pour produire cette vitesse et un
mécanicien pour conduire cette machine, j’en conclus... que nous sommes
sauvés.
— Hum ! » fit Ned Land d’un ton réservé.
En ce moment, et comme pour donner raison à mon argumentation, un
bouillonnement se fit à l’arrière de cet étrange appareil, dont le propulseur
était évidemment une hélice, et il se mit en mouvement. Nous n’eûmes que
le temps de nous accrocher à sa partie supérieure qui émergeait de
quatre−vingts centimètres environ. Très heureusement sa vitesse n’était
pas excessive.
« Tant qu’il navigue horizontalement, murmura Ned Land, je n’ai rien à
dire. Mais s’il lui prend la fantaisie de plonger, je ne donnerais pas deux
dollars de ma peau ! »
Moins encore, aurait pu dire le Canadien. Il devenait donc urgent de
communiquer avec les êtres quelconques renfermés dans les flancs de cette
machine. Je cherchai à sa surface une ouverture, un panneau, « un trou
d’homme », pour employer l’expression technique ; mais les lignes de
boulons, solidement rabattues sur la jointure des tôles, étaient nettes et
uniformes.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 57
D’ailleurs, la lune disparut alors, et nous laissa dans une obscurité
profonde. Il fallut attendre le jour pour aviser aux moyens de pénétrer à
l’intérieur de ce bateau sous−marin.
Ainsi donc, notre salut dépendait uniquement du caprice des mystérieux
timoniers qui dirigeaient cet appareil, et, s’ils plongeaient, nous étions
perdus ! Ce cas excepté, je ne doutais pas de la possibilité d’entrer en
relations avec eux. Et, en effet, s’ils ne faisaient pas eux−mêmes leur air, il
fallait nécessairement qu’ils revinssent de temps en temps à la surface de
l’Océan pour renouveler leur provision de molécules respirables. Donc,
nécessité d’une ouverture qui mettait l’intérieur du bateau en
communication avec l’atmosphère.
Quant à l’espoir d’être sauvé par le commandant Farragut, il fallait y
renoncer complètement. Nous étions entraînés vers l’ouest, et j’estimai que
notre vitesse, relativement modérée, atteignait douze milles à l’heure.
L’hélice battait les flots avec une régularité mathématique, émergeant
quelquefois et faisant jaillir l’eau phosphorescente à une grande hauteur.
Vers quatre heures du matin, la rapidité de l’appareil s’accrut. Nous
résistions difficilement à ce vertigineux entraînement, lorsque les lames
nous battaient de plein fouet. Heureusement, Ned rencontra sous sa main
un large organeau fixé à la partie supérieure du dos de tôle, et nous
parvînmes à nous y accrocher solidement.
Enfin cette longue nuit s’écoula. Mon souvenir incomplet ne permet pas
d’en retracer toutes les impressions. Un seul détail me revient à l’esprit.
Pendant certaines accalmies de la mer et du vent, je crus entendre plusieurs
fois des sons vagues, une sorte d’harmonie fugitive produite par des
accords lointains. Quel était donc le mystère de cette navigation
sous−marine dont le monde entier cherchait vainement l’explication ?
Quels êtres vivaient dans cet étrange bateau ? Quel agent mécanique lui
permettait de se déplacer avec une si prodigieuse vitesse ?
Le jour parut. Les brumes du matin nous enveloppaient, mais elles ne
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 58
tardèrent pas à se déchirer. J’allais procéder à un examen attentif de la
coque qui formait à sa partie supérieure une sorte de plate−forme
horizontale, quand je la sentis s’enfoncer peu à peu.
« Eh ! mille diables ! s’écria Ned Land, frappant du pied la tôle sonore,
ouvrez donc, navigateurs peu hospitaliers ! »
Mais il était difficile de se faire entendre au milieu des battements
assourdissants de l’hélice. Heureusement, le mouvement d’immersion
s’arrêta.
Soudain, un bruit de ferrures violemment poussées se produisit à l’intérieur
du bateau. Une plaque se souleva, un homme parut, jeta un cri bizarre et
disparut aussitôt.
Quelques instants après, huit solides gaillards, le visage voilé,
apparaissaient silencieusement, et nous entraînaient dans leur formidable
machine.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une baleine d'espèce inconnue 59
Mobilis in mobile
Cet enlèvement, si brutalement exécuté, s’était accompli avec la rapidité de
l’éclair. Mes compagnons et moi, nous n’avions pas eu le temps de nous
reconnaître. Je ne sais ce qu’ils éprouvèrent en se sentant introduits dans
cette prison flottante ; mais, pour mon compte, un rapide frisson me glaça
l’épiderme. A qui avions−nous affaire ? Sans doute à quelques pirates
d’une nouvelle espèce qui exploitaient la mer à leur façon.
A peine l’étroit panneau fut−il refermé sur moi, qu’une obscurité profonde
m’enveloppa. Mes yeux, imprégnés de la lumière extérieure, ne purent rien
percevoir. Je sentis mes pieds nus se cramponner aux échelons d’une
échelle de fer. Ned Land et Conseil, vigoureusement saisis, me suivaient.
Au bas de l’échelle, une porte s’ouvrit et se referma immédiatement sur
nous avec un retentissement sonore.
Nous étions seuls. Où ? Je ne pouvais le dire, à peine l’imaginer. Tout était
noir, mais d’un noir si absolu, qu’après quelques minutes, mes yeux
n’avaient encore pu saisir une de ces lueurs indéterminées qui flottent dans
les plus profondes nuits.
Cependant, Ned Land, furieux de ces façons de procéder, donnait un libre
cours à son indignation.
« Mille diables ! s’écriait−il, voilà des gens qui en remonteraient aux
Calédoniens pour l’hospitalité ! Il ne leur manque plus que d’être
anthropophages ! Je n’en serais pas surpris, mais je déclare que l’on ne me
mangera pas sans que je proteste !
— Calmez−vous, ami Ned, calmez−vous, répondit tranquillement Conseil.
Ne vous emportez pas avant l’heure. Nous ne sommes pas encore dans la
rôtissoire !
Mobilis in mobile 60
— Dans la rôtissoire, non, riposta le Canadien, mais dans le four, à coup
sûr ! Il y fait assez noir. Heureusement, mon bowie−kniff ne m’a pas
quitté, et j’y vois toujours assez clair pour m’en servir. Le premier de ces
bandits qui met la main sur moi...
— Ne vous irritez pas, Ned, dis−je alors au harponneur, et ne nous
compromettez point par d’inutiles violences. Qui sait si on ne nous écoute
pas ! Tâchons plutôt de savoir où nous sommes ! »
Je marchai en tâtonnant. Après cinq pas, je rencontrai une muraille de fer,
faite de tôles boulonnées. Puis, me retournant, je heurtai une table de bois,
près de laquelle étaient rangés plusieurs escabeaux. Le plancher de cette
prison se dissimulait sous une épaisse natte de phormium qui assourdissait
le bruit des pas. Les murs nus ne révélaient aucune trace de porte ni de
fenêtre. Conseil, faisant un tour en sens inverse, me rejoignit, et nous
revînmes au milieu de cette cabine, qui devait avoir vingt pieds de long sur
dix pieds de large. Quant à sa hauteur, Ned Land, malgré sa grande taille,
ne put la mesurer.
Une demi−heure s’était déjà écoulée sans que la situation se fût modifiée,
quand, d’une extrême obscurité, nos yeux passèrent subitement à la plus
violente lumière. Notre prison s’éclaira soudain, c’est−à−dire qu’elle
s’emplit d’une matière lumineuse tellement vive que je ne pus d’abord en
supporter l’éclat. A sa blancheur, à son intensité, je reconnus cet éclairage
électrique, qui produisait autour du bateau sous−marin comme un
magnifique phénomène de phosphorescence. Après avoir involontairement
fermé les yeux, je les rouvris, et je vis que l’agent lumineux s’échappait
d’un demi−globe dépoli qui s’arrondissait à la partie supérieure de la
cabine.
« Enfin ! on y voit clair ! s’écria Ned Land, qui, son couteau à la main, se
tenait sur la défensive.
— Oui, répondis−je, risquant l’antithèse, mais la situation n’en est pas
moins obscure.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 61
— Que monsieur prenne patience », dit l’impassible Conseil.
Le soudain éclairage de la cabine m’avait permis d’en examiner les
moindres détails. Elle ne contenait que la table et les cinq escabeaux. La
porte invisible devait être hermétiquement fermée. Aucun bruit n’arrivait à
notre oreille. Tout semblait mort à l’intérieur de ce bateau. Marchait−il, se
maintenait−il à la surface de l’Océan, s’enfonçait−il dans ses profondeurs ?
Je ne pouvais le deviner.
Cependant, le globe lumineux ne s’était pas allumé sans raison. j’espérais
donc que les hommes de l’équipage ne tarderaient pas à se montrer. Quand
on veut oublier les gens, on n’éclaire pas les oubliettes.
Je ne me trompais pas. Un bruit de verrou se fit entendre, la porte s’ouvrit,
deux hommes parurent.
L’un était de petite taille, vigoureusement musclé, large d’épaules, robuste
de membres, la tête forte, la chevelure abondante et noire, la moustache
épaisse, le regard vif et pénétrant, et toute sa personne empreinte de cette
vivacité méridionale qui caractérise en France les populations provençales.
Diderot a très justement prétendu que le geste de l’homme est
métaphorique, et ce petit homme en était certainement la preuve vivante.
On sentait que dans son langage habituel, il devait prodiguer les
prosopopées, les métonymies et les hypallages. Ce que. d’ailleurs, je ne fus
jamais à même de vérifier, car il employa toujours devant moi un idiome
singulier et absolument incompréhensible.
Le second inconnu mérite une description plus détaillée. Un disciple de
Gratiolet ou d’Engel eût lu sur sa physionomie à livre ouvert. Je reconnus
sans hésiter ses qualités dominantes – la confiance en lui, car sa tête se
dégageait noblement sur l’arc formé par la ligne de ses épaules, et ses yeux
noirs regardaient avec une froide assurance : – le calme, car sa peau, pâle
plutôt que colorée, annonçait la tranquillité du sang ; – l’énergie, que
démontrait la rapide contraction de ses muscles sourciliers ; le courage
enfin, car sa vaste respiration dénotait une grande expansion vitale.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 62
J’ajouterai que cet homme était fier, que son regard ferme et calme
semblait refléter de hautes pensées, et que de tout cet ensemble, de
l’homogénéité des expressions dans les gestes du corps et du visage,
suivant l’observation des physionomistes, résultait une indiscutable
franchise.
Je me sentis « involontairement » rassuré en sa présence, et j’augurai bien
de notre entrevue.
Ce personnage avait−il trente−cinq ou cinquante ans, je n’aurais pu le
préciser. Sa taille était haute, son front large, son nez droit, sa bouche
nettement dessinée. ses dents magnifiques, ses mains fines, allongées,
éminemment « psychiques » pour employer un mot de la chirognomonie,
c’est−à−dire dignes de servir une âme haute et passionnée. Cet homme
formait certainement le plus admirable type que j’eusse jamais rencontré.
Détail particulier, ses yeux, un peu écartés l’un de l’autre, pouvaient
embrasser simultanément près d’un quart de l’horizon. Cette faculté je l’ai
vérifié plus tard se doublait d’une puissance de vision encore supérieure à
celle de Ned Land. Lorsque cet inconnu fixait un objet, la ligne de ses
sourcils se fronçait, ses larges paupières se rapprochaient de manière à
circonscrire la pupille des yeux et à rétrécir ainsi l’étendue du champ
visuel, et il regardait ! Quel regard ! comme il grossissait les objets
rapetissés par l’éloignement ! comme il vous pénétrait jusqu’à l’âme !
comme il perçait ces nappes liquides, si opaques à nos yeux, et comme il
lisait au plus profond des mers ! ...
Les deux inconnus, coiffés de bérets faits d’une fourrure de loutre marine,
et chaussés de bottes de mer en peau de phoque, portaient des vêtements
d’un tissu particulier, qui dégageaient la taille et laissaient une grande
liberté de mouvements.
Le plus grand des deux évidemment le chef du bord – nous examina avec
une extrême attention, sans prononcer une parole. Puis, se retournant vers
son compagnon, il s’entretint avec lui dans une langue que je ne pus
reconnaître. C’était un idiome sonore, harmonieux, flexible, dont les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 63
voyelles semblaient soumises à une accentuation très variée.
L’autre répondit par un hochement de tête, et ajouta deux ou trois mots
parfaitement incompréhensibles. Puis du regard il parut m’interroger
directement.
Je répondis, en bon français, que je n’entendais point son langage ; mais il
ne sembla pas me comprendre, et la situation devint assez embarrassante.
« Que monsieur raconte toujours notre histoire, me dit Conseil. Ces
messieurs en saisiront peut−être quelques mots ! »
Je recommençai le récit de nos aventures, articulant nettement toutes mes
syllabes, et sans omettre un seul détail. Je déclinai nos noms et qualités ;
puis, je présentai dans les formes le professeur Aronnax, son domestique
Conseil, et maître Ned Land, le harponneur.
L’homme aux yeux doux et calmes m’écouta tranquillement, poliment
même, et avec une attention remarquable. Mais rien dans sa physionomie
n’indiqua qu’il eût compris mon histoire. Quand j’eus fini, il ne prononça
pas un seul mot.
Restait encore la ressource de parler anglais. Peut−être se ferait−on
entendre dans cette langue qui est à peu près universelle. Je la connaissais,
ainsi que la langue allemande, d’une manière suffisante pour la lire
couramment, mais non pour la parler correctement. Or, ici, il fallait surtout
se faire comprendre.
« Allons, à votre tour, dis−je au harponneur. A vous, maître Land, tirez de
votre sac le meilleur anglais qu’ait jamais parlé un Anglo−Saxon. et tâchez
d’être plus heureux que moi. »
Ned ne se fit pas prier et recommença mon récit que je compris à peu près.
Le fond fut le même, mais la forme différa.Le Canadien, emporté par son
caractère, y mit beaucoup d’animation. Il se plaignit violemment d’être
emprisonné au mépris du droit des gens, demanda en vertu de quelle loi on
le retenait ainsi, invoqua l’habeas corpus, menaça de poursuivre ceux qui
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 64
le séquestraient indûment, se démena, gesticula, cria, et finalement, il fit
comprendre par un geste expressif que nous mourions de faim.
Ce qui était parfaitement vrai, mais nous l’avions à peu près oublié.
A sa grande stupéfaction, le harponneur ne parut pas avoir été plus
intelligible que moi. Nos visiteurs ne sourcillèrent pas. Il était évident
qu’ils ne comprenaient ni la langue d’Arago ni celle de Faraday.
Fort embarrassé, après avoir épuisé vainement nos ressources
philologiques, je ne savais plus quel parti prendre, quand Conseil me dit :
« Si monsieur m’y autorise, je raconterai la chose en allemand.
— Comment ! tu sais l’allemand ? m’écriai−je.
— Comme un Flamand, n’en déplaise à monsieur.
— Cela me plaît, au contraire. Va, mon garçon. »
Et Conseil, de sa voix tranquille, raconta pour la troisième fois les diverses
péripéties de notre histoire. Mais, malgré les élégantes tournures et la belle
accentuation du narrateur, la langue allemande n’eut aucun succès.
Enfin, poussé à bout, je rassemblai tout ce qui me restait de mes premières
études, et j’entrepris de narrer nos aventures en latin. Cicéron se fût bouché
les oreilles et m’eût renvoyé à la cuisine, mais cependant, je parvins à
m’en tirer. Même résultat négatif.
Cette dernière tentative définitivement avortée, les deux inconnus
échangèrent quelques mots dans leur incompréhensible langage, et se
retirèrent, sans même nous
avoir adresse un de ces gestes rassurants qui ont cours dans tous les pays
du monde. La porte se referma.
« C’est une infamie ! s’écria Ned Land, qui éclata pour la vingtième fois.
Comment ! on leur parle français, anglais, allemand, latin, à ces
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 65
coquins−là, et il n’en est pas un qui ait la civilité de répondre !
Calmez−vous, Ned, dis−je au bouillant harponneur, la colère ne mènerait à
rien.
— Mais savez−vous, monsieur le professeur, reprit notre irascible
compagnon, que l’on mourrait parfaitement de faim dans cette cage de
fer ?
— Bah ! fit Conseil, avec de la philosophie, on peut encore tenir
longtemps !
— Mes amis, dis−je, il ne faut pas se désespérer. Nous nous sommes
trouvés dans de plus mauvaises passes. Faites−moi donc le plaisir
d’attendre pour vous former une opinion sur le commandant et l’équipage
de ce bateau.
— Mon opinion est toute faite, riposta Ned Land. Ce sont des coquins...
— Bon ! et de quel pays ?
— Du pays des coquins !
— Mon brave Ned, ce pays−là n’est pas encore suffisamment indiqué sur
la mappemonde, et j’avoue que la nationalité de ces deux inconnus est
difficile à déterminer ! Ni Anglais, ni Français, ni Allemands, voilà tout ce
que l’on peut affirmer. Cependant, je serais tenté d’admettre que ce
commandant et son second sont nés sous de basses latitudes. Il y a du
méridional en eux. Mais sont−ils espagnols, turcs, arabes ou indiens, c’est
ce que leur type physique ne me permet pas de décider. Quant à leur
langage. il est absolument incompréhensible.
Voilà le désagrément de ne pas savoir toutes les langues, répondit Conseil,
ou le désavantage de ne pas avoir une langue unique !
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 66
— Ce qui ne servirait à rien ! répondit Ned Land. Ne voyez−vous pas que
ces gens−là ont un langage à eux, un langage inventé pour désespérer les
braves gens qui demandent à dîner ! Mais, dans tous les pays de la terre
ouvrir la bouche, remuer les mâchoires, happer des dents et des lèvres,
est−ce que cela ne se comprend pas de reste ? Est−ce que cela ne veut pas
dire à Québec comme aux Pomotou, à Paris comme aux antipodes : J’ai
faim ! donnez−moi à manger ! ...
— Oh ! fit Conseil, il y a des natures si inintelligentes ! ... »
Comme il disait ces mots, la porte s’ouvrit. Un stewart entra. Il nous
apportait des vêtements, vestes et culottes de mer, faites d’une étoffe dont
je ne reconnus pas la nature. Je me hâtai de les revêtir, et mes compagnons
m’imitèrent.
Pendant ce temps, le stewart muet, sourd peut−être avait disposé la table et
placé trois couverts.
« Voilà quelque chose de sérieux, dit Conseil, et cela s’annonce bien.
— Bah ! répondit le rancunier harponneur, que diable voulez−vous qu’on
mange ici ? du foie de tortue, du filet de requin, du beefsteak de chien de
mer !
— Nous verrons bien ! » dit Conseil.
Les plats, recouverts de leur cloche d’argent, furent symétriquement posés
sur la nappe, et nous prîmes place à table. Décidément, nous avions affaire
à des gens civilisés, et sans la lumière électrique qui nous inondait, je me
serais cru dans la salle à manger de l’hôtel Adelphi, à Liverpool, ou du
Grand−Hôtel, à Paris. Je dois dire toutefois que le pain et le vin
manquaient totalement. L’eau était fraîche et limpide, mais c’était de l’eau
– ce qui ne fut pas du goût de Ned Land. Parmi les mets qui nous furent
servis, je reconnus divers poissons délicatement apprêtés ; mais, sur
certains plats, excellents d’ailleurs, je ne pus me prononcer, et je n’aurais
même su dire à quel règne, végétal ou animal, leur contenu appartenait.

Quant au service de table, il était élégant et d’un goût parfait. Chaque
ustensile, cuiller, fourchette, couteau, assiette, portait une lettre entourée
d’une devise en exergue, et dont voici le fac−similé exact :
Mobile dans l’élément mobile ! Cette devise s’appliquait justement à cet
appareil sous−marin, à la condition de traduire la préposition in par dans et
non par sur. La lettre N formait sans doute l’initiale du nom de
l’énigmatique personnage qui commandait au fond des mers !
Ned et Conseil ne faisaient pas tant de réflexions. Ils dévoraient, et je ne
tardai pas à les imiter. J’étais, d’ailleurs, rassuré sur notre sort, et il me
paraissait évident que nos hôtes ne voulaient pas nous laisser mourir
d’inanition.
Cependant, tout finit ici−bas, tout passe, même la faim de gens qui n’ont
pas mangé depuis quinze heures. Notre appétit satisfait, le besoin de
sommeil se fit impérieusement sentir. Réaction bien naturelle, après
l’interminable nuit pendant laquelle nous avions lutté contre la mort.
« Ma foi, je dormirais bien, dit Conseil.
— Et moi, je dors ! » répondit Ned Land.
Mes deux compagnons s’étendirent sur le tapis de la cabine, et furent
bientôt plongés dans un profond sommeil.
Pour mon compte, je cédai moins facilement à ce violent besoin de dormir.
Trop de pensées s’accumulaient dans mon esprit, trop de questions
insolubles s’y pressaient, trop d’images tenaient mes paupières
entr’ouvertes ! Où étions−nous ? Quelle étrange puissance nous
emportait ? Je sentais – ou plutôt je croyais sentir – l’appareil s’enfoncer
vers les couches les plus reculées de la mer. De violents cauchemars
m’obsédaient. J’entrevoyais dans ces mystérieux asiles tout un monde
d’animaux inconnus, dont ce bateau sous−marin semblait être le
congénère, vivant, se mouvant, formidable comme eux ! ... Puis, mon
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 68
cerveau se calma, mon imagination se fondit en une vague somnolence, et
je tombai bientôt dans un morne sommeil.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Mobilis in mobile 69
Les colères de Ned Land
Quelle fut la durée de ce sommeil, je l’ignore ; mais il dut être long, car il
nous reposa complètement de nos fatigues. Je me réveillai le premier. Mes
compagnons n’avaient pas encore bougé, et demeuraient étendus dans leur
coin comme des masses inertes.
A peine relevé de cette couche passablement dure, je sentis mon cerveau
dégagé, mon esprit net. Je recommençai alors un examen attentif de notre
cellule.
Rien n’était changé à ses dispositions intérieures. La prison était restée
prison, et les prisonniers, prisonniers. Cependant le stewart, profitant de
notre sommeil, avait desservi la table. Rien n’indiquait donc une
modification prochaine dans cette situation, et je me demandai
sérieusement si nous étions destinés à vivre indéfiniment dans cette cage.
Cette perspective me sembla d’autant plus pénible que, si mon cerveau
était libre de ses obsessions de la veille, je me sentais la poitrine
singulièrement oppressée. Ma respiration se faisait difficilement. L’air
lourd ne suffisait plus au jeu de mes poumons. Bien que la cellule fût
vaste, il était évident que nous avions consommé en grande partie
l’oxygène qu’elle contenait. En effet, chaque homme dépense en une
heure, l’oxygène renfermé dans cent litres d’air et cet air, chargé alors
d’une quantité presque égale d’acide carbonique, devient irrespirable.
Il était donc urgent de renouveler l’atmosphère de notre prison, et, sans
doute aussi, L’atmosphère du bateau sous−marin.
Là se posait une question à mon esprit. Comment procédait le commandant
de cette demeure flottante ? Obtenait−il de l’air par des moyens chimiques,
en dégageant par la chaleur l’oxygène contenu dans du chlorate de potasse,
et en absorbant l’acide carbonique par la potasse caustique ? Dans ce cas, il
Les colères de Ned Land 70
devait avoir conservé quelques relations avec les continents, afin de se
procurer les matières nécessaires à cette opération. Se bornait−il seulement
à emmagasiner l’air sous de hautes pressions dans des réservoirs, puis à le
répandre suivant les besoins de son équipage ? Peut−être. Ou, procédé plus
commode. plus économique, et par conséquent plus probable, se
contentait−il de revenir respirer à la surface des eaux, comme un cétacé. et
de renouveler pour vingt−quatre heures sa provision d’atmosphère ? Quoi
qu’il en soit. et quelle que fût la méthode, il me paraissait prudent de
l’employer sans retard.
En effet, j’étais déjà réduit à multiplier mes inspirations pour extraire de
cette cellule le peu d’oxygène qu’elle renfermait, quand, soudain, je fus
rafraîchi par un courant d’air pur et tout parfumé d’émanations salines.
C’était bien la brise de mer, vivifiante et chargée d’iode ! J’ouvris
largement la bouche, et mes poumons se saturèrent de fraîches molécules.
En même temps, je sentis un balancement, un roulis de médiocre
amplitude, mais parfaitement déterminable. Le bateau, le monstre de tôle
venait évidemment de remonter à la surface de l’Océan pour y respirer à la
façon des baleines. Le mode de ventilation du navire était donc
parfaitement reconnu.
Lorsque j’eus absorbé cet air pur à pleine poitrine, je cherchai le conduit, l’
» aérifère », si l’on veut, qui laissait arriver jusqu’à nous ce bienfaisant
effluve. et je ne tardai pas à le trouver. Au−dessus de la porte s’ouvrait un
trou d’aérage laissant passer une fraîche colonne d’air, qui renouvelait
ainsi l’atmosphère appauvrie de la cellule.
J’en étais là de mes observations, quand Ned et Conseil s’éveillèrent
presque en même temps, sous l’influence de cette aération revivifiante. Ils
se frottèrent les yeux, se détirèrent les bras et furent sur pied en un instant.
« Monsieur a bien dormi ? me demanda Conseil avec sa politesse
quotidienne.
— Fort bien, mon brave garçon, répondis−je. Et, vous, maître Ned Land ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 71
— Profondément, monsieur le professeur. Mais, je ne sais si je me trompe,
il me semble que je respire comme une brise de mer ? »
Un marin ne pouvait s’y méprendre, et je racontai au Canadien ce qui
s’était passé pendant son sommeil.
« Bon ! dit−il, cela explique parfaitement ces mugissements que nous
entendions, lorsque le prétendu narwal se trouvait en vue de
l’Abraham−Lincoln.
— Parfaitement, maître Land, c’était sa respiration !
— Seulement, monsieur Aronnax, je n’ai aucune idée de l’heure qu’il est,
à moins que ce ne soit l’heure du dîner ?
— L’heure du dîner, mon digne harponneur ? Dites, au moins, l’heure du
déjeuner, car nous sommes certainement au lendemain d’hier.
— Ce qui démontre, répondit Conseil, que nous avons pris vingt−quatre
heures de sommeil.
— C’est mon avis. répondis−je.
— Je ne vous contredis point, répliqua Ned Land. Mais dîner ou déjeuner,
le stewart sera le bienvenu, qu’il apporte l’un ou l’autre.
— L’un et l’autre, dit Conseil
— Juste, répondit le Canadien, nous avons droit à deux repas, et pour mon
compte, je ferai honneur à tous les deux.
— Eh bien ! Ned, attendons, répondis−je. Il est évident que ces inconnus
n’ont pas l’intention de nous laisser mourir de faim, car, dans ce cas, le
dîner d’hier soir n’aurait aucun sens.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 72
— A moins qu’on ne nous engraisse ! riposta Ned.
— Je proteste, répondis−je. Nous ne sommes point tombés entre les mains
de cannibales !
— Une fois n’est pas coutume, répondit sérieusement le Canadien. Qui sait
si ces gens−là ne sont pas privés depuis longtemps de chair fraîche, et dans
ce cas, trois particuliers sains et bien constitués comme monsieur le
professeur, son domestique et moi...
— Chassez ces idées, maître Land, répondis−je au harponneur, et surtout.
ne partez pas de là pour vous emporter contre nos hôtes, ce qui ne pourrait
qu’aggraver la situation.
— En tout cas, dit le harponneur, j’ai une faim de tous les diables, et dîner
ou déjeuner, le repas n’arrive guère !
— Maître Land, répliquai−je, il faut se conformer au règlement du bord, et
je suppose que notre estomac avance sur la cloche du maître−coq.
— Eh bien ! on le mettra à l’heure, répondit tranquillement Conseil.
— Je vous reconnais là, ami Conseil, riposta l’impatient Canadien. Vous
usez peu votre bile et vos nerfs ! Toujours calme ! Vous seriez capable de
dire vos grâces avant votre bénédicité, et de mourir de faim plutôt que de
vous plaindre !
— A quoi cela servirait−il ? demanda Conseil.
— Mais cela servirait à se plaindre ! C’est déjà quelque chose. Et si ces
pirates — je dis pirates par respect, et pour ne pas contrarier monsieur le
professeur qui défend de les appeler cannibales —, si ces pirates se
figurent qu’ils vont me garder dans cette cage où j’étouffe, sans apprendre
de quels jurons j’assaisonne mes emportements, ils se trompent ! Voyons,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 73
monsieur Aronnax. parlez franchement. Croyez−vous qu’ils nous tiennent
longtemps dans cette boîte de fer ?
— A dire vrai, je n’en sais pas plus long que vous, ami Land.
— Mais enfin, que supposez−vous ?
— Je suppose que le hasard nous a rendus maîtres d’un secret important.
Or, l’équipage de ce bateau sous−marin a intérêt à le garder, et si cet
intérêt est plus grave que la vie de trois hommes, je crois notre existence
très compromise. Dans le cas contraire, à la première occasion, le monstre
qui nous a engloutis nous rendra au monde habité par nos semblables.
— A moins qu’il ne nous enrôle parmi son équipage, dit Conseil, et qu’il
nous garde ainsi...
— Jusqu’au moment, répliqua Ned Land, où quelque frégate, plus rapide
ou plus adroite que l’Abraham−Lincoln, s’emparera de ce nid de forbans,
et enverra son équipage et nous respirer une dernière fois au bout de sa
grand’vergue.
— Bien raisonné, maître Land, répliquai−je. Mais on ne nous a pas encore
fait, que je sache, de proposition à cet égard. Inutile donc de discuter le
parti que nous devrons prendre, le cas échéant. Je vous le répète, attendons,
prenons conseil des circonstances, et ne faisons rien, puisqu’il n’y a rien à
faire.
— Au contraire ! monsieur le professeur, répondit le harponneur, qui n’en
voulait pas démordre, il faut faire quelque chose.
— Eh ! quoi donc, maître Land ?
— Nous sauver.
— Se sauver d’une prison « terrestre » est souvent difficile, mais d’une
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 74
prison sous−marine, cela me paraît absolument impraticable.
— Allons, ami Ned, demanda Conseil, que répondez−vous à l’objection de
monsieur ? Je ne puis croire qu’un Américain soit jamais à bout de
ressources ! »
Le harponneur. visiblement embarrassé, se taisait. Une fuite, dans les
conditions où le hasard nous avait jetés, était absolument impossible. Mais
un Canadien est à demi français, et maître Ned Land le fit bien voir par sa
réponse.
« Ainsi, monsieur Aronnax, reprit−il après quelques instants de réflexion,
vous ne devinez pas ce que doivent faire des gens qui ne peuvent
s’échapper de leur prison ?
— Non, mon ami.
— C’est bien simple, il faut qu’ils s’arrangent de manière à y rester.
— Parbleu ! fit Conseil, vaut encore mieux être dedans que dessus ou
dessous !
— Mais après avoir jeté dehors geôliers, porte−clefs et gardiens, ajouta
Ned Land.
— Quoi, Ned ? vous songeriez sérieusement à vous emparer de ce
bâtiment ?
— Très sérieusement, répondit le Canadien.
— C’est impossible.
— Pourquoi donc, monsieur ? Il peut se présenter quelque chance
favorable, et je ne vois pas ce qui pourrait nous empêcher d’en profiter.
S’ils ne sont qu’une vingtaine d’hommes à bord de cette machine, ils ne
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 75
feront pas reculer deux Français et un Canadien, je suppose ! »
Mieux valait admettre la proposition du harponneur que de la discuter.
Aussi, me contentai−je de répondre :
« Laissons venir les circonstances, maître Land, et nous verrons. Mais,
jusque−là, je vous en prie, contenez votre impatience. On ne peut agir que
par ruse, et ce n’est pas en vous emportant que vous ferez naître des
chances favorables. Promettez−moi donc que vous accepterez la situation
sans trop de colère.
— Je vous le promets, monsieur le professeur, répondit Ned Land d’un ton
peu rassurant. Pas un mot violent ne sortira de ma bouche, pas un geste
brutal ne me trahira, quand bien même le service de la table ne se ferait pas
avec toute la régularité désirable.
— J’ai votre parole, Ned », répondis−je au Canadien.
Puis, la conversation fut suspendue, et chacun de nous se mit à réfléchir à
part soi. J’avouerai que, pour mon compte, et malgré l’assurance du
harponneur, je ne conservais aucune illusion. Je n’admettais pas ces
chances favorables dont Ned Land avait parlé. Pour être si sûrement
manoeuvré, le bateau sous−marin exigeait un nombreux équipage, et
conséquemment, dans le cas d’une lutte, nous aurions affaire à trop forte
partie. D’ailleurs, il fallait, avant tout, être libres, et nous ne l’étions pas. Je
ne voyais même aucun moyen de fuir cette cellule de tôle si
hermétiquement fermée. Et pour peu que l’étrange commandant de ce
bateau eût un secret à garder — ce qui paraissait au moins probable il ne
nous laisserait pas agir librement à son bord. Maintenant, se
débarrasserait−il de nous par la violence, ou nous jetterait−il un jour sur
quelque coin de terre ? C’était là l’inconnu. Toutes ces hypothèses me
semblaient extrêmement plausibles, et il fallait être un harponneur pour
espérer de reconquérir sa liberté.
Je compris d’ailleurs que les idées de Ned Land s’aigrissaient avec les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 76
réflexions qui s’emparaient de son cerveau. J’entendais peu à peu les
jugements gronder au fond de son gosier, et je voyais ses gestes redevenir
menaçants. Il se levait, tournait comme une bête fauve en cage, frappait les
murs du pied et du poing. D’ailleurs, le temps s’écoulait, la faim se faisait
cruellement sentir, et, cette fois, le stewart ne paraissait pas. Et c’était
oublier trop longtemps notre position de naufragés, si l’on avait réellement
de bonnes intentions à notre égard.
Ned Land, tourmenté par les tiraillements de son robuste estomac, se
montait de plus en plus, et, malgré sa parole, je craignais véritablement une
explosion, lorsqu’il se trouverait en présence de l’un des hommes du bord.
Pendant deux heures encore, la colère de Ned Land s’exalta. Le Canadien
appelait, il criait, mais en vain. Les murailles de tôle étaient sourdes. Je
n’entendais même aucun bruit à l’intérieur de ce bateau, qui semblait mort.
Il ne bougeait pas, car j’aurais évidemment senti les frémissements de la
coque sous l’impulsion de l’hélice. Plongé sans doute dans l’abîme des
eaux, il n’appartenait plus à la terre. Tout ce morne silence était effrayant.
Quant à notre abandon, notre isolement au fond de cette cellule, je n’osais
estimer ce qu’il pourrait durer. Les espérances que j’avais conçues après
notre entrevue avec le commandant du bord s’effaçaient peu à peu. La
douceur du regard de cet homme, l’expression généreuse de sa
physionomie, la noblesse de son maintien, tout disparaissait de mon
souvenir. Je revoyais cet énigmatique personnage tel qu’il devait être,
nécessairement impitoyable, cruel. Je le sentais en dehors de l’humanité,
inaccessible à tout sentiment de pitié, implacable ennemi de ses semblables
auxquels il avait dû vouer une impérissable haine !
Mais, cet homme, allait−il donc nous laisser périr d’inanition, enfermés
dans cette prison étroite livrés à ces horribles tentations auxquelles pousse
la faim farouche ? Cette affreuse pensée prit dans mon esprit une intensité
terrible, et l’imagination aidant, je me sentis envahir par une épouvante
insensée. Conseil restait calme, Ned Land rugissait.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 77
En ce moment, un bruit se fit entendre extérieurement.
Des pas résonnèrent sur la dalle de métal. Les serrures furent fouillées, la
porte s’ouvrit, le stewart parut.
Avant que j’eusse fait un mouvement pour l’en empêcher, le Canadien
s’était précipité sur ce malheureux ; il l’avait renversé ; il le tenait à la
gorge. Le stewart étouffait sous sa main puissante.
Conseil cherchait déjà à retirer des mains du harponneur sa victime à demi
suffoquée, et j’allais joindre mes efforts aux siens, quand, subitement, je
fus cloué à ma place par ces mots prononcés en français :
« Calmez−vous, maître Land, et vous, monsieur le professeur, veuillez
m’écouter ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les colères de Ned Land 78
L'homme des eaux
C’était le commandant du bord qui parlait ainsi.
A ces mots, Ned Land se releva subitement. Le stewart, presque étranglé
sortit en chancelant sur un signe de son maître ; mais tel était l’empire du
commandant à son bord, que pas un geste ne trahit le ressentiment dont cet
homme devait être animé contre le Canadien. Conseil, intéressé malgré lui,
moi stupéfait, nous attendions en silence le dénouement de cette scène.
Le commandant, appuyé sur l’angle de la table, les bras croisés, nous
observait avec une profonde attention. Hésitait−il à parler ? Regrettait−il
ces mots qu’il venait de prononcer en français ? On pouvait le croire.
Après quelques instants d’un silence qu’aucun de nous ne songea à
interrompre :
« Messieurs, dit−il d’une voix calme et pénétrante, je parle également le
français, l’anglais, l’allemand et le latin. J’aurais donc pu vous répondre
dès notre première entrevue, mais je voulais vous connaître d’abord,
réfléchir ensuite. Votre quadruple récit, absolument semblable au fond,
m’a affirmé l’identité de vos personnes. Je sais maintenant que le hasard a
mis en ma présence monsieur Pierre Aronnax, professeur d’histoire
naturelle au Muséum de Paris, chargé d’une mission scientifique à
l’étranger, Conseil son domestique, et Ned Land, d’origine canadienne,
harponneur à bord de la frégate l’Abraham−Lincoln, de la marine
nationale des États−Unis d’Amérique. »
Je m’inclinai d’un air d’assentiment. Ce n’était pas une question que me
posait le commandant. Donc, pas de réponse à faire. Cet homme
s’exprimait avec une aisance parfaite, sans aucun accent. Sa phrase était
nette, ses mots justes, sa facilité d’élocution remarquable. Et cependant, je
L'homme des eaux 79
ne « sentais » pas en lui un compatriote.
Il reprit la conversation en ces termes :
« Vous avez trouvé sans doute, monsieur, que j’ai longtemps tardé à vous
rendre cette seconde visite. C’est que, votre identité reconnue, je voulais
peser mûrement le parti à prendre envers vous. J’ai beaucoup hésité. Les
plus fâcheuses circonstances vous ont mis en présence d’un homme qui a
rompu avec l’humanité. Vous êtes venu troubler mon existence...
— Involontairement, dis−je.
— Involontairement ? répondit l’inconnu, en forçant un peu sa voix.
Est−ce involontairement que l’Abraham−Lincoln me chasse sur toutes les
mers ? Est−ce involontairement que vous avez pris passage à bord de cette
frégate ? Est−ce involontairement que vos boulets ont rebondi sur la coque
de mon navire ? Est−ce involontairement que maître Ned Land m’a frappé
de son harpon ? »
Je surpris dans ces paroles une irritation contenue. Mais, à ces
récriminations j’avais une réponse toute naturelle à faire, et je la fis.
« Monsieur, dis−je, vous ignorez sans doute les discussions qui ont eu lieu
à votre sujet en Amérique et en Europe. Vous ne savez pas que divers
accidents, provoqués par le choc de votre appareil sous−marin, ont ému
l’opinion publique dans les deux continents. Je vous fais grâce des
hypothèses sans nombre par lesquelles on cherchait à expliquer
l’inexplicable phénomène dont seul vous aviez le secret. Mais sachez
qu’en vous poursuivant jusque sur les hautes mers du Pacifique,
l’Abraham−Lincoln croyait chasser quelque puissant monstre marin dont il
fallait à tout prix délivrer l’Océan. »
Un demi−sourire détendit les lèvres du commandant, puis, d’un ton plus
calme :
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 80
« Monsieur Aronnax, répondit−il, oseriez−vous affirmer que votre frégate
n’aurait pas poursuivi et canonné un bateau sous−marin aussi bien qu’un
monstre ? »
Cette question m’embarrassa, car certainement le commandant Farragut
n’eût pas hésité. Il eût cru de son devoir de détruire un appareil de ce genre
tout comme un narwal gigantesque.
« Vous comprenez donc, monsieur, reprit l’inconnu, que j’ai le droit de
vous traiter en ennemis. »
Je ne répondis rien, et pour cause. A quoi bon discuter une proposition
semblable, quand la force peut détruire les meilleurs arguments.
« J’ai longtemps hésité, reprit le commandant. Rien ne m’obligeait à vous
donner l’hospitalité. Si je devais me séparer de vous, je n’avais aucun
intérêt à vous revoir. Je vous remettais sur la plate−forme de ce navire qui
vous avait servi de refuge. Je m’enfonçais sous les mers, et j’oubliais que
vous aviez jamais existé. N’était−ce pas mon droit ?
— C’était peut−être le droit d’un sauvage, répondis−je, ce n’était pas celui
d’un homme civilisé.
— Monsieur le professeur, répliqua vivement le commandant, je ne suis
pas ce que vous appelez un homme civilisé ! J’ai rompu avec la société
tout entière pour des raisons que moi seul j’ai le droit d’apprécier. Je
n’obéis donc point à ses règles, et je vous engage à ne jamais les invoquer
devant moi ! »
Ceci fut dit nettement. Un éclair de colère et de dédain avait allumé les
yeux de l’inconnu, et dans la vie de cet homme, j’entrevis un passé
formidable. Non seulement il s’était mis en dehors des lois humaines, mais
il s’était fait indépendant, libre dans la plus rigoureuse acception du mot,
hors de toute atteinte ! Qui donc oserait le poursuivre au fond des mers,
puisque, à leur surface, il déjouait les efforts tentés contre lui ? Quel navire
résisterait au choc de son monitor sous−marin ? Quelle cuirasse, si épaisse
qu’elle fût, supporterait les coups de son éperon ? Nul, entre les hommes,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 81
ne pouvait lui demander compte de ses oeuvres. Dieu, s’il y croyait, sa
conscience, s’il en avait une, étaient les seuls juges dont il put dépendre.
Ces réflexions traversèrent rapidement mon esprit. pendant que l’étrange
personnage se taisait, absorbé et comme retiré en lui−même. Je le
considérais avec un effroi mélangé d’intérêt, et sans doute, ainsi
qu’OEdipe considérait le Sphinx.
Après un assez long silence, le commandant reprit la parole.
« J’ai donc hésité, dit−il, mais j’ai pensé que mon intérêt pouvait
s’accorder avec cette pitié naturelle à laquelle tout être humain a droit.
Vous resterez à mon bord, puisque la fatalité vous y a jetés. Vous y serez
libres, et, en échange de cette liberté, toute relative d’ailleurs, je ne vous
imposerai qu’une seule condition. Votre parole de vous y soumettre me
suffira.
— Parlez, monsieur, répondis−je, je pense que cette condition est de celles
qu’un honnête homme peut accepter ?
— Oui, monsieur, et la voici. Il est possible que certains événements
imprévus m’obligent à vous consigner dans vos cabines pour quelques
heures ou quelques jours, suivant le cas. Désirant ne jamais employer la
violence, j’attends de vous, dans ce cas, plus encore que dans tous les
autres, une obéissance passive. En agissant ainsi, je couvre votre
responsabilité, je vous dégage entièrement, car c’est à moi de vous mettre
dans l’impossibilité de voir ce qui ne doit pas être vu. Acceptez−vous cette
condition ? »
Il se passait donc à bord des choses tout au moins singulières, et que ne
devaient point voir des gens qui ne s’étaient pas mis hors des lois sociales !
Entre les surprises que l’avenir me ménageait, celle−ci ne devait pas être la
moindre.
« Nous acceptons, répondis−je. Seulement, je vous demanderai, monsieur,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 82
la permission de vous adresser une question, une seule.
— Parlez, monsieur.
— Vous avez dit que nous serions libres à votre bord ?
— Entièrement.
— Je vous demanderai donc ce que vous entendez par cette liberté.
— Mais la liberté d’aller, de venir, de voir, d’observer même tout ce qui se
passe ici – sauf en quelques circonstances graves −, la liberté enfin dont
nous jouissons nous−mêmes, mes compagnons et moi. »
Il était évident que nous ne nous entendions point.
« Pardon, monsieur, repris−je, mais cette liberté, ce n’est que celle que tout
prisonnier a de parcourir sa prison ! Elle ne peut nous suffire.
— Il faudra, cependant, qu’elle vous suffise !
— Quoi ! nous devons renoncer à jamais de revoir notre patrie, nos amis,
nos parents !
— Oui, monsieur. Mais renoncer à reprendre cet insupportable joug de la
terre, que les hommes croient être la liberté, n’est peut−être pas aussi
pénible que vous le pensez !
— Par exemple, s’écria Ned Land, jamais je ne donnerai ma parole de ne
pas chercher à me sauver !
— Je ne vous demande pas de parole, maître Land répondit froidement le
commandant.
— Monsieur, répondis−je, emporté malgré moi, vous abusez de votre
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 83
situation envers nous ! C’est de la cruauté !
— Non, monsieur, c’est de la clémence ! Vous êtes mes prisonniers après
combat ! Je vous garde, quand je pourrais d’un mot vous replonger dans
les abîmes de l’Océan ! Vous m’avez attaqué ! Vous êtes venus surprendre
un secret que nul homme au monde ne doit pénétrer, le secret de toute mon
existence ! Et vous croyez que Je vais vous renvoyer sur cette terre qui ne
doit plus me connaître ! Jamais ! En vous retenant, ce n’est pas vous que je
garde, c’est moi−même ! »
Ces paroles indiquaient de la part du commandant un parti pris contre
lequel ne prévaudrait aucun argument.
« Ainsi, monsieur, repris−je, vous nous donnez tout simplement à choisir
entre la vie ou la mort ?
— Tout simplement.
— Mes amis, dis−je, à une question ainsi posée, il n’y a rien à répondre.
Mais aucune parole ne nous lie au maître de ce bord.
— Aucune, monsieur », répondit l’inconnu.
Puis, d’une voix plus douce, il reprit :
« Maintenant, permettez−moi d’achever ce que j’ai à vous dire. Je vous
connais, monsieur Aronnax. Vous, sinon vos compagnons, vous n’aurez
peut−être pas tant à vous plaindre du hasard qui vous lie à mon sort. Vous
trouverez parmi les livres qui servent à mes études favorites cet ouvrage
que vous avez publié sur les grands fonds de la mer. Je l’ai souvent lu.
Vous avez poussé votre oeuvre aussi loin que vous le permettait la science
terrestre. Mais vous ne savez pas tout, vous n’avez pas tout vu.
Laissez−moi donc vous dire, monsieur le professeur, que vous ne
regretterez pas le temps passé à mon bord. Vous allez voyager dans le pays
des merveilles. L’étonnement, la stupéfaction seront probablement l’état
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 84
habituel de votre esprit. Vous ne vous blaserez pas facilement sur le
spectacle incessamment offert à vos yeux. Je vais revoir dans un nouveau
tour du monde sous−marin – qui sait ? le dernier peut−être – tout ce que
j’ai pu étudier au fond de ces mers tant de fois parcourues, et vous serez
mon compagnon d’études. A partir de ce jour, vous entrez dans un nouvel
élément, vous verrez ce que n’a vu encore aucun homme car moi et les
miens nous ne comptons plus – et notre planète, grâce à moi, va vous livrer
ses derniers secrets. »
Je ne puis le nier ; ces paroles du commandant firent sur moi un grand
effet. J’étais pris là par mon faible, et j’oubliai, pour un instant, que la
contemplation de ces choses sublimes ne pouvait valoir la liberté perdue.
D’ailleurs, je comptais sur l’avenir pour trancher cette grave question.
Ainsi, je me contentai de répondre :
« Messieurs, si vous avez brisé avec l’humanité, je veux croire que vous
n’avez pas renié tout sentiment humain. Nous sommes des naufragés
charitablement recueillis à votre bord, nous ne l’oublierons pas. Quant à
moi, je ne méconnais pas que, si l’intérêt de la science pouvait absorber
jusqu’au besoin de liberté, ce que me promet notre rencontre m’offrirait de
grandes compensations. »
Je pensais que le commandant allait me tendre la main pour sceller notre
traité. Il n’en fit rien. Je le regrettai pour lui.
« Une dernière question, dis−je, au moment où cet être inexplicable
semblait vouloir se retirer.
— Parlez, monsieur le professeur.
— De quel nom dois−je vous appeler ?
— Monsieur, répondit le commandant, je ne suis pour vous que le
capitaine Nemo, et vos compagnons et vous, n’êtes pour moi que les
passagers du Nautilus. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 85
Le capitaine Nemo appela. Un stewart parut. Le capitaine lui donna ses
ordres dans cette langue étrangère que je ne pouvais reconnaître. Puis, se
tournant vers le Canadien et Conseil :
« Un repas vous attend dans votre cabine, leur dit−il. Veuillez suivre cet
homme.
— Ça n’est pas de refus ! » répondit le harponneur.
Conseil et lui sortirent enfin de cette cellule où ils étaient renfermés depuis
plus de trente heures.
« Et maintenant, monsieur Aronnax, notre déjeuner est prêt.
Permettez−moi de vous précéder.
— A vos ordres, capitaine. »
Je suivis le capitaine Nemo, et dès que j’eus franchi la porte, je pris une
sorte de couloir électriquement éclairé, semblable aux coursives d’un
navire. Après un parcours d’une dizaine de mètres. une seconde porte
s’ouvrit devant moi.
J’entrai alors dans une salle à manger ornée et meublée avec un goût
sévère. De hauts dressoirs de chêne, incrustés d’ornements d’ébène,
s’élevaient aux deux extrémités de cette salle, et sur leurs rayons à ligne
ondulée étincelaient des faïences, des porcelaines, des verreries d’un prix
inestimable. La vaisselle plate y resplendissait sous les rayons que versait
un plafond lumineux, dont de fines peintures tamisaient et adoucissaient
l’éclat.
Au centre de la salle était une table richement servie. Le capitaine Nemo
m’indiqua la place que je devais occuper.
« Asseyez−vous, me dit−il, et mangez comme un homme qui doit mourir
de faim. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 86
Le déjeuner se composait d’un certain nombre de plats dont la mer seule
avait fourni le contenu, et de quelques mets dont j’ignorais la nature et la
provenance. J’avouerai que c’était bon, mais avec un goût particulier
auquel je m’habituai facilement. Ces divers aliments me parurent riches en
phosphore, et je pensai qu’ils devaient avoir une origine marine.
Le capitaine Nemo me regardait. Je ne lui demandai rien, mais il devina
mes pensées, et il répondit de lui−même aux questions que je brûlais de lui
adresser.
« La plupart de ces mets vous sont inconnus, me dit−il. Cependant, vous
pouvez en user sans crainte. Ils sont sains et nourrissants. Depuis
longtemps, j’ai renoncé aux aliments de la terre, et je ne m’en porte pas
plus mal. Mon équipage, qui est vigoureux, ne se nourrit pas autrement que
moi.
— Ainsi, dis−je, tous ces aliments sont des produits de la mer ?
— Oui, monsieur le professeur, la mer fournit à tous mes besoins. Tantôt,
je mets mes filets a la traîne, et je les retire, prêts à se rompre. Tantôt, je
vais chasser au milieu de cet élément qui paraît être inaccessible à
l’homme, et je force le gibier qui gîte dans mes forêts sous−marines. Mes
troupeaux, comme ceux du vieux pasteur de Neptune, paissent sans crainte
les immenses prairies de l’Océan. J’ai là une vaste propriété que j’exploite
moi−même et qui est toujours ensemencée par la main du Créateur de
toutes choses. »
Je regardai le capitaine Nemo avec un certain étonnement, et je lui
répondis :
« Je comprends parfaitement, monsieur, que vos filets fournissent
d’excellents poissons à votre table ; je comprends moins que vous
poursuiviez le gibier aquatique dans vos forêts sous−marines ; mais je ne
comprends plus du tout qu’une parcelle de viande, si petite qu’elle soit,
figure dans votre menu.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 87
— Aussi, monsieur, me répondit le capitaine Nemo, ne fais−je jamais
usage de la chair des animaux terrestres.
— Ceci, cependant, repris−je, en désignant un plat où restaient encore
quelques tranches de filet.
— Ce que vous croyez être de la viande, monsieur le professeur, n’est
autre chose que du filet de tortue de mer. Voici également quelques foies
de dauphin que vous prendriez pour un ragoût de porc. Mon cuisinier est
un habile préparateur, qui excelle à conserver ces produits variés de
l’Océan. Goûtez à tous ces mets. Voici une conserve d’holoturies qu’un
Malais déclarerait sans rivale au monde, voilà une crème dont le lait a été
fourni par la mamelle des cétacés, et le sucre par les grands fucus de la mer
du Nord, et enfin, permettez−moi de vous offrir des confitures d’anémones
qui valent celles des fruits les plus savoureux. »
Et je goûtais, plutôt en curieux qu’en gourmet, tandis que le capitaine
Nemo m’enchantait par ses invraisemblables récits.
« Mais cette mer, monsieur Aronnax, me dit−il, cette nourrice prodigieuse,
inépuisable, elle ne me nourrit pas seulement ; elle me vêtit encore. Ces
étoffes qui vous couvrent sont tissées avec le byssus de certains
coquillages ; elles sont teintes avec la pourpre des anciens et nuancées de
couleurs violettes que j’extrais des aplysis de la Méditerranée. Les parfums
que vous trouverez sur la toilette de votre cabine sont le produit de la
distillation des plantes marines. Votre lit est fait du plus doux zostère de
l’Océan. Votre plume sera un fanon de baleine, votre encre la liqueur
sécrétée par la seiche ou l’encornet. Tout me vient maintenant de la mer
comme tout lui retournera un jour !
— Vous aimez la mer, capitaine.
— Oui ! je l’aime ! La mer est tout ! Elle couvre les sept dixièmes du
globe terrestre. Son souffle est pur et sain. C’est l’immense désert où
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 88
l’homme n’est jamais seul, car il sent frémir la vie à ses côtés. La mer n’est
que le véhicule d’une surnaturelle et prodigieuse existence ; elle n’est que
mouvement et amour ; c’est l’infini vivant, comme l’a dit un de vos poètes.
Et en effet, monsieur le professeur, la nature s’y manifeste par ses trois
règnes, minéral, végétal, animal. Ce dernier y est largement représenté par
les quatre groupes des zoophytes, par trois classes des articulés, par cinq
classes des mollusques, par trois classes des vertébrés, les mammifères, les
reptiles et ces innombrables légions de poissons, ordre infini d’animaux
qui compte plus de treize mille espèces, dont un dixième seulement
appartient à l’eau douce. La mer est le vaste réservoir de la nature. C’est
par la mer que le globe a pour ainsi dire commencé, et qui sait s’il ne finira
pas par elle ! Là est la suprême tranquillité. La mer n’appartient pas aux
despotes. A sa surface, ils peuvent encore exercer des droits iniques, s’y
battre, s’y dévorer, y transporter toutes les horreurs terrestres. Mais à trente
pieds au−dessous de son niveau, leur pouvoir cesse, leur influence s’éteint,
leur puissance disparaît ! Ah ! monsieur, vivez, vivez au sein des mers ! Là
seulement est l’indépendance ! Là je ne reconnais pas de maîtres ! Là je
suis libre ! »
Le capitaine Nemo se tut subitement au milieu de cet enthousiasme qui
débordait de lui. S’était−il laissé entraîner au−delà de sa réserve
habituelle ? Avait−il trop parlé ? Pendant quelques instants, il se promena,
très agité. Puis, ses nerfs se calmèrent, sa physionomie reprit sa froideur
accoutumée, et, se tournant vers moi :
« Maintenant, monsieur le professeur, dit−il, si vous voulez visiter le
Nautilus, je suis a vos ordres. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'homme des eaux 89
Le Nautilus
Le capitaine Nemo se leva. Je le suivis. Une double porte, ménagée à
l’arrière de la salle, s’ouvrit, et j’entrai dans une chambre de dimension
égale à celle que je venais de quitter.
C’était une bibliothèque. De hauts meubles en palissandre noir, incrustés
de cuivres, supportaient sur leurs larges rayons un grand nombre de livres
uniformément reliés. Ils suivaient le contour de la salle et se terminaient à
leur partie inférieure par de vastes divans, capitonnés de cuir marron, qui
offraient les courbes les plus confortables. De légers pupitres mobiles, en
s’écartant ou se rapprochant à volonté, permettaient d’y poser le livre en
lecture. Au centre se dressait une vaste table, couverte de brochures, entre
lesquelles apparaissaient quelques journaux déjà vieux. La lumière
électrique inondait tout cet harmonieux ensemble, et tombait de quatre
globes dépolis à demi engagés dans les volutes du plafond. Je regardais
avec une admiration réelle cette salle si ingénieusement aménagée, et je ne
pouvais en croire mes yeux.
« Capitaine Nemo, dis−je à mon hôte, qui venait de s’étendre sur un divan,
voilà une bibliothèque qui ferait honneur à plus d’un palais des continents,
et je suis vraiment émerveillé, quand je songe qu’elle peut vous suivre au
plus profond des mers.
— Où trouverait−on plus de solitude, plus de silence, monsieur le
professeur ? répondit le capitaine Nemo. Votre cabinet du Muséum vous
offre−t−il un repos aussi complet ?
— Non, monsieur, et je dois ajouter qu’il est bien pauvre auprès du vôtre.
Vous possédez la six ou sept mille volumes...
— Douze mille, monsieur Aronnax. Ce sont les seuls liens qui me
Le Nautilus 90
rattachent à la terre. Mais le monde a fini pour moi le jour où mon Nautilus
s’est plongé pour la première fois sous les eaux. Ce jour−là, j’ai acheté
mes derniers volumes, mes dernières brochures, mes derniers journaux, et
depuis lors, je veux croire que l’humanité n’a plus ni pensé, ni écrit. Ces
livres, monsieur le professeur, sont d’ailleurs à votre disposition, et vous
pourrez en user librement. »
Je remerciai le capitaine Nemo, et je m’approchai des rayons de la
bibliothèque. Livres de science, de morale et de littérature, écrits en toute
langue, y abondaient ; mais je ne vis pas un seul ouvrage d’économie
politique ; ils semblaient être sévèrement proscrits du bord. Détail curieux,
tous ces livres étaient indistinctement classés, en quelque langue qu’ils
fussent écrits, et ce mélange prouvait que le capitaine du Nautilus devait
lire couramment les volumes que sa main prenait au hasard.
Parmi ces ouvrages, je remarquai les chefs−d’oeuvre des maîtres anciens et
modernes, c’est−à−dire tout ce que l’humanité a produit de plus beau dans
l’histoire, la poésie, le roman et la science, depuis Homère jusqu’à Victor
Hugo, depuis Xénophon jusqu’à Michelet, depuis Rabelais jusqu’à
madame Sand. Mais la science, plus particulièrement, faisait les frais de
cette bibliothèque ; les livres de mécanique, de balistique, d’hydrographie,
de météorologie, de géographie, de géologie, etc. , y tenaient une place non
moins importante que les ouvrages d’histoire naturelle, et je compris qu’ils
formaient la principale étude du capitaine. Je vis là tout le Humboldt, tout
l’Arago, les travaux de Foucault, d’Henry Sainte−Claire Deville, de
Chasles, de Milne−Edwards, de Quatrefages, de Tyndall, de Faraday, de
Berthelot, de l’abbé Secchi, de Petermann, du commandant Maury,
d’Agassis etc. Les mémoires de l’Académie des sciences, les bulletins des
diverses sociétés de géographie, etc. , et, en bon rang, les deux volumes qui
m’avaient peut−être valu cet accueil relativement charitable du capitaine
Nemo. Parmi les oeuvres de Joseph Bertrand, son livre intitulé les
Fondateurs de l’Astronomie me donna même une date certaine ; et comme
je savais qu’il avait paru dans le courant de 1865, je pus en conclure que
l’installation du Nautilus ne remontait pas à une époque postérieure. Ainsi
donc, depuis trois ans, au plus, le capitaine Nemo avait commencé son
existence sous−marine. J’espérai, d’ailleurs, que des ouvrages plus récents
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 91
encore me permettraient de fixer exactement cette époque ; mais j’avais le
temps de faire cette recherche, et je ne voulus pas retarder davantage notre
promenade à travers les merveilles du Nautilus.
« Monsieur, dis−je au capitaine, je vous remercie d’avoir mis cette
bibliothèque à ma disposition. Il y a là des trésors de science, et j’en
profiterai.
— Cette salle n’est pas seulement une bibliothèque, dit le capitaine Nemo,
c’est aussi un fumoir.
— Un fumoir ? m’écriai−je. On fume donc à bord ?
— Sans doute.
— Alors, monsieur, je suis forcé de croire que vous avez conservé des
relations avec La Havane.
— Aucune, répondit le capitaine. Acceptez ce cigare, monsieur Aronnax,
et, bien qu’il ne vienne pas de La Havane, vous en serez content, si vous
êtes connaisseur. »
Je pris le cigare qui m’était offert, et dont la forme rappelait celle du
londrès ; mais il semblait fabriqué avec des feuilles d’or. Je l’allumai à un
petit brasero que supportait un élégant pied de bronze, et j’aspirai ses
premières bouffées avec la volupté d’un amateur qui n’a pas fumé depuis
deux jours.
« C’est excellent, dis−je, mais ce n’est pas du tabac.
— Non, répondit le capitaine, ce tabac ne vient ni de La Havane ni de
l’Orient. C’est une sorte d’algue, riche en nicotine, que la mer me fournit,
non sans quelque parcimonie. Regrettez−vous les londrès, monsieur ?
— Capitaine, je les méprise à partir de ce jour.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 92
— Fumez donc à votre fantaisie, et sans discuter l’origine de ces cigares.
Aucune régie ne les a contrôlés, mais ils n’en sont pas moins bons,
j’imagine.
— Au contraire. »
A ce moment le capitaine Nemo ouvrit une porte qui faisait face à celle par
laquelle j’étais entré dans la bibliothèque, et je passai dans un salon
immense et splendidement éclairé.
C’était un vaste quadrilatère, à pans coupés, long de dix mètres, large de
six, haut de cinq. Un plafond lumineux, décoré de légères arabesques,
distribuait un jour clair et doux sur toutes les merveilles entassées dans ce
musée. Car, c’était réellement un musée dans lequel une main intelligente
et prodigue avait réuni tous les trésors de la nature et de l’art, avec ce
pêle−mêle artiste qui distingue un atelier de peintre.
Une trentaine de tableaux de maîtres, à cadres uniformes, séparés par
d’étincelantes panoplies, ornaient les parois tendues de tapisseries d’un
dessin sévère. Je vis là des toiles de la plus haute valeur, et que, pour la
plupart, j’avais admirées dans les collections particulières de l’Europe et
aux expositions de peinture. Les diverses écoles des maîtres anciens étaient
représentées par une madone de Raphaël, une vierge de Léonard de Vinci,
une nymphe du Corrège, une femme du Titien, une adoration de Véronèse,
une assomption de Murillo, un portrait d’Holbein, un moine de Vélasquez,
un martyr de Ribeira, une kermesse de Rubens, deux paysages flamands de
Téniers, trois petits tableaux de genre de Gérard Dow, de Metsu, de Paul
Potter, deux toiles de Géricault et de Prudhon, quelques marines de
Backuysen et de Vernet. Parmi les oeuvres de la peinture moderne,
apparaissaient des tableaux signés Delacroix, Ingres, Decamps, Troyon,
Meissonnier, Daubigny, etc. , et quelques admirables réductions de statues
de marbre ou de bronze, d’après les plus beaux modèles de l’antiquité, se
dressaient sur leurs piédestaux dans les angles de ce magnifique musée.
Cet état de stupéfaction que m’avait prédit le commandant du Nautilus
commençait déjà à s’emparer de mon esprit.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 93
« Monsieur le professeur, dit alors cet homme étrange, vous excuserez le
sans−gêne avec lequel je vous reçois, et le désordre qui règne dans ce
salon.
— Monsieur, répondis−je, sans chercher à savoir qui vous êtes, m’est−il
permis de reconnaître en vous un artiste ?
— Un amateur, tout au plus, monsieur. J’aimais autrefois à collectionner
ces belles oeuvres créées par la main de l’homme. J’étais un chercheur
avide, un fureteur infatigable, et j’ai pu réunir quelques objets d’un haut
prix. Ce sont mes derniers souvenirs de cette terre qui est morte pour moi.
A mes yeux, vos artistes modernes ne sont déjà plus que des anciens ; ils
ont deux ou trois mille ans d’existence, et je les confonds dans mon esprit.
Les maîtres n’ont pas d’âge.
— Et ces musiciens ? dis−je, en montrant des partitions de Weber, de
Rossini, de Mozart, de Beethoven, d’Haydn, de Meyerbeer, d’Herold, de
Wagner, d’Auber, de Gounod, et nombre d’autres, éparses sur un
pianoorgue de grand modèle qui occupait un des panneaux du salon.
— Ces musiciens, me répondit le capitaine Nemo, ce sont des
contemporains d’Orphée, car les différences chronologiques s’effacent
dans la mémoire des morts – et je suis mort, monsieur le professeur, aussi
bien mort que ceux de vos amis qui reposent à six pieds sous terre ! »
Le capitaine Nemo se tut et sembla perdu dans une rêverie profonde. Je le
considérais avec une vive émotion, analysant en silence les étrangetés de
sa physionomie. Accoudé sur l’angle d’une précieuse table de mosaïque, il
ne me voyait plus, il oubliait ma présence.
Je respectai ce recueillement, et je continuai de passer en revue les
curiosités qui enrichissaient ce salon.
Auprès des oeuvres de l’art, les raretés naturelles tenaient une place très
importante. Elles consistaient principalement en plantes, en coquilles et
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 94
autres productions de l’Océan, qui devaient être les trouvailles
personnelles du capitaine Nemo. Au milieu du salon, un jet d’eau,
électriquement éclairé, retombait dans une vasque faite d’un seul tridacne.
Cette coquille, fournie par le plus grand des mollusques acéphales,
mesurait sur ses bords, délicatement festonnés, une circonférence de six
mètres environ ; elle dépassait donc en grandeur ces beaux tridacnes qui
furent donnés à François 1er par la République de Venise, et dont l’église
Saint−Sulpice, à Paris, a fait deux bénitiers gigantesques.
Autour de cette vasque, sous d’élégantes vitrines fixées par des armatures
de cuivre, étaient classés et étiquetés les plus précieux produits de la mer
qui eussent jamais été livrés aux regards d’un naturaliste. On conçoit ma
joie de professeur.
L’embranchement des zoophytes offrait de très curieux spécimens de ses
deux groupes des polypes et des échinodermes. Dans le premier groupe,
des tubipores, des gorgones disposées en éventail, des éponges douces de
Syrie, des isis des Molluques, des pennatules, une virgulaire admirable des
mers de Norvège, des ombellulaires variées, des alcyonnaires, toute une
série de ces madrépores que mon maître Milne−Edwards a si sagacement
classés en sections, et parmi lesquels je remarquai d’adorables flabellines,
des oculines de l’île Bourbon, le « char de Neptune » des Antilles, de
superbes variétés de coraux, enfin toutes les espèces de ces curieux
polypiers dont l’assemblage forme des îles entières qui deviendront un jour
des continents. Dans les échinodermes, remarquables par leur enveloppe
épineuse, les astéries, les étoiles de mer, les pantacrines, les comatules, les
astérophons, les oursins, les holoturies, etc., représentaient la collection
complète des individus de ce groupe.
Un conchyliologue un peu nerveux se serait pâmé certainement devant
d’autres vitrines plus nombreuses où étaient classés les échantillons de
l’embranchement des mollusques. Je vis là une collection d’une valeur
inestimable, et que le temps me manquerait à décrire tout entière. Parmi
ces produits, je citerai, pour mémoire seulement, – l’élégant marteau royal
de l’Océan indien dont les régulières taches blanches ressortaient vivement
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 95
sur un fond rouge et brun, – un spondyle impérial, aux vives couleurs, tout
hérissé d’épines, rare spécimen dans les muséums européens, et dont
j’estimai la valeur à vingt mille francs, un marteau commun des mers de la
Nouvelle−Hollande, qu’on se procure difficilement, – des buccardes
exotiques du Sénégal, fragiles coquilles blanches à doubles valves, qu’un
souffle eût dissipées comme une bulle de savon, – plusieurs variétés des
arrosoirs de Java, sortes de tubes calcaires bordés de replis foliacés, et très
disputés par les amateurs, – toute une série de troques, les uns jaune
verdâtre, pêchés dans les mers d’Amérique, les autres d’un brun roux, amis
des eaux de la Nouvelle−Hollande, ceux−ci, venus du golfe du Mexique, et
remarquables par leur coquille imbriquée, ceux−là, des stellaires trouvés
dans les mers australes, et enfin, le plus rare de tous, le magnifique éperon
de la Nouvelle−Zélande ; –puis, d’admirables tellines sulfurées, de
précieuses espèces de cythérées et de Vénus, le cadran treillissé des côtes
de Tranquebar, le sabot marbré à nacre resplendissante, les perroquets
verts des mers de Chine, le cône presque inconnu du genre Coenodulli,
toutes les variétés de porcelaines qui servent de monnaie dans l’Inde et en
Afrique, la « Gloire de la Mer », la plus précieuse coquille des Indes
orientales ; – enfin des littorines, des dauphinules, des turritelles des
janthines, des ovules, des volutes, des olives, des mitres, des casques, des
pourpres, des buccins, des harpes, des rochers, des tritons, des cérites, des
fuseaux, des strombes, des pterocères, des patelles, des hyales, des
cléodores, coquillages délicats et fragiles, que la science a baptisés de ses
noms les plus charmants.
A part, et dans des compartiments spéciaux, se déroulaient des chapelets
de perles de la plus grande beauté, que la lumière électrique piquait de
pointes de feu, des perles roses, arrachées aux pinnes marines de la mer
Rouge, des perles vertes de l’haliotyde iris, des perles jaunes, bleues,
noires, curieux produits des divers mollusques de tous les océans et de
certaines moules des cours d’eau du Nord, enfin plusieurs échantillons
d’un prix inappréciable qui avaient été distillés par les pintadines les plus
rares. Quelques−unes de ces perles surpassaient en grosseur un oeuf de
pigeon ; elles valaient, et au−delà, celle que le voyageur Tavernier vendit
trois millions au shah de Perse, et primaient cette autre perle de l’iman de
Mascate, que je croyais sans rivale au monde.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 96
Ainsi donc, chiffrer la valeur de cette collection était, pour ainsi dire,
impossible. Le capitaine Nemo avait dû dépenser des millions pour
acquérir ces échantillons divers, et je me demandais à quelle source il
puisait pour satisfaire ainsi ses fantaisies de collectionneur, quand je fus
interrompu par ces mots :
« Vous examinez mes coquilles, monsieur le professeur. En effet, elles
peuvent intéresser un naturaliste ; mais, pour moi, elles ont un charme de
plus, car je les ai toutes recueillies de ma main, et il n’est pas une mer du
globe qui ait échappé à mes recherches.
— Je comprends, capitaine, je comprends cette joie de se promener au
milieu de telles richesses. Vous êtes de ceux qui ont fait eux−mêmes leur
trésor. Aucun muséum de l’Europe ne possède une semblable collection
des produits de l’Océan. Mais si j’épuise mon admiration pour elle, que me
restera−t−il pour le navire qui les porte ! Je ne veux point pénétrer des
secrets qui sont les vôtres ! Cependant, j’avoue que ce Nautilus, la force
motrice qu’il renferme en lui, les appareils qui permettent de le
manoeuvrer, l’agent si puissant qui l’anime, tout cela excite au plus haut
point ma curiosité. Je vois suspendus aux murs de ce salon des instruments
dont la destination m’est inconnue. Puis−je savoir ? ...
— Monsieur Aronnax, me répondit le capitaine Nemo, je vous ai dit que
vous seriez libre à mon bord, et par conséquent, aucune partie du Nautilus
ne vous est interdite. Vous pouvez donc le visiter en détail et je me ferai un
plaisir d’être votre cicérone.
— Je ne sais comment vous remercier, monsieur, mais je n’abuserai pas de
votre complaisance. Je vous demanderai seulement à quel usage sont
destinés ces instruments de physique...
— Monsieur le professeur, ces mêmes instruments se trouvent dans ma
chambre, et c’est là que j’aurai le plaisir de vous expliquer leur emploi.
Mais auparavant, venez visiter la cabine qui vous est réservée. Il faut que
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 97
vous sachiez comment vous serez installé à bord du Nautilus. »
Je suivis le capitaine Nemo, qui, par une des portes percées à chaque pan
coupé du salon, me fit rentrer dans les coursives du navire. Il me conduisit
vers l’avant, et là je trouvai, non pas une cabine, mais une chambre
élégante, avec lit, toilette et divers autres meubles.
Je ne pus que remercier mon hôte.
« Votre chambre est contiguë à la mienne, me dit−il, en ouvrant une porte,
et la mienne donne sur le salon que nous venons de quitter. »
J’entrai dans la chambre du capitaine. Elle avait un aspect sévère, presque
cénobitique. Une couchette de fer, une table de travail, quelques meubles
de toilette. Le tout éclairé par un demi−jour. Rien de confortable. Le strict
nécessaire, seulement.
Le capitaine Nemo me montra un siège.
« Veuillez vous asseoir », me dit−il.
Je m’assis, et il prit la parole en ces termes :
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le Nautilus 98
Tout par l'électricité
« Monsieur, dit le capitaine Nemo, me montrant les instruments suspendus
aux parois de sa chambre, voici les appareils exigés par la navigation du
Nautilus. Ici comme dans le salon, je les ai toujours sous les yeux, et ils
m’indiquent ma situation et ma direction exacte au milieu de l’Océan. Les
uns vous sont connus, tels que le thermomètre qui donne la température
intérieure du Nautilus ; le baromètre, qui pèse le poids de l’air et prédit les
changements de temps ; l’hygromètre, qui marque le degré de sécheresse
de l’atmosphère ; le storm−glass, dont le mélange, en se décomposant,
annonce l’arrivée des tempêtes ; la boussole, qui dirige ma route ; le
sextant, qui par la hauteur du soleil m’apprend ma latitude ; les
chronomètres, qui me permettent de calculer ma longitude ; et enfin des
lunettes de jour et de nuit, qui me servent à scruter tous les points de
l’horizon, quand le Nautilus est remonté à la surface des flots.
— Ce sont les instruments habituels au navigateur, répondis−je, et j’en
connais l’usage. Mais en voici d’autres qui répondent sans doute aux
exigences particulières du Nautilus. Ce cadran que j’aperçois et que
parcourt une aiguille mobile, n’est−ce pas un manomètre ?
— C’est un manomètre, en effet. Mis en communication avec l’eau dont il
indique la pression extérieure, il me donne par là même la profondeur à
laquelle se maintient mon appareil.
— Et ces sondes d’une nouvelle espèce ?
— Ce sont des sondes thermométriques qui rapportent la température des
diverses couches d’eau.
— Et ces autres instruments dont je ne devine pas l’emploi ?

— Ici, monsieur le professeur, je dois vous donner quelques explications,
dit le capitaine Nemo. Veuillez donc m’écouter. »
Il garda le silence pendant quelques instants, puis il dit :
« Il est un agent puissant, obéissant, rapide, facile, qui se plie à tous les
usages et qui règne en maître à mon bord. Tout se fait par lui. Il m’éclaire,
il m’échauffe, il est l’âme de mes appareils mécaniques. Cet agent, c’est
l’électricité.
— L’électricité ! m’écriai−je assez surpris.
— Oui, monsieur.
— Cependant, capitaine, vous possédez une extrême rapidité de
mouvements qui s’accorde mal avec le pouvoir de l’électricité. Jusqu’ici,
sa puissance dynamique est restée très restreinte et n’a pu produire que de
petites forces !
— Monsieur le professeur, répondit le capitaine Nemo, mon électricité
n’est pas celle de tout le monde, et c’est là tout ce que vous me permettrez
de vous en dire.
— Je n’insisterai pas. monsieur, et je me contenterai d’être très étonné
d’un tel résultat. Une seule question, cependant, à laquelle vous ne
répondrez pas si elle est indiscrète. Les éléments que vous employez pour
produire ce merveilleux agent doivent s’user vite. Le zinc, par exemple,
comment le remplacez−vous, puisque vous n’avez plus aucune
communication avec la terre ?
— Votre question aura sa réponse, répondit le capitaine Nemo. Je vous
dirai, d’abord, qu’il existe au fond des mers des mines de zinc, de fer,
d’argent, d’or, dont l’exploitation serait très certainement praticable. Mais
je n’ai rien emprunté à ces métaux de la terre, et j’ai voulu ne demander
qu’à la mer elle−même les moyens de produire mon électricité.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Tout par l'électricité 100
— A la mer ?
— Oui, monsieur le professeur, et les moyens ne me manquaient pas.
J’aurais pu, en effet, en établissant un circuit entre des fils plongés à
différentes profondeurs, obtenir l’électricité par la diversité de
températures qu’ils éprouvaient ; mais j’ai préféré employer un système
plus pratique.
— Et lequel ?
— Vous connaissez la composition de l’eau de mer. Sur mille grammes on
trouve quatre−vingt−seize centièmes et demi d’eau, et deux centièmes
deux tiers environ de chlorure de sodium ; puis. en petite quantité, des
chlorures de magnésium et de potassium, du bromure de magnésium, du
sulfate de magnésie, du sulfate et du carbonate de chaux. Vous voyez donc
que le chlorure de sodium s’y rencontre dans une proportion notable. Or,
c’est ce sodium que j’extrais de l’eau de mer et dont je compose mes
éléments.
— Le sodium ?
— Oui, monsieur. Mélangé avec le mercure, il forme un amalgame qui
tient lieu du zinc dans les éléments Bunzen. Le mercure ne s’use jamais.
Le sodium seul se consomme, et la mer me le fournit elle−même. Je vous
dirai, en outre, que les piles au sodium doivent être considérées comme les
plus énergiques, et que leur force électromotrice est double de celle des
piles au zinc.
— Je comprends bien, capitaine, l’excellence du sodium dans les
conditions où vous vous trouvez. La mer le contient. Bien. Mais il faut
encore le fabriquer, l’extraire en un mot. Et comment faites−vous ? Vos
piles pourraient évidemment servir à cette extraction ; mais, si je ne me
trompe, la dépense du sodium nécessitée par les appareils électriques
dépasserait la quantité extraite. Il arriverait donc que vous en
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Tout par l'électricité 101
consommeriez pour le produire plus que vous n’en produiriez !
— Aussi, monsieur le professeur, je ne l’extrais pas par la pile, et
j’emploie tout simplement la chaleur du charbon de terre.
— De terre ? dis−je en insistant.
Disons le charbon de mer, si vous voulez, répondit le capitaine Nemo.
— Et vous pouvez exploiter des mines sous−marines de houille ?
— Monsieur Aronnax, vous me verrez à l’oeuvre. Je ne vous demande
qu’un peu de patience, puisque vous avez le temps d’être patient.
Rappelez−vous seulement ceci : je dois tout à l’Océan ; il produit
l’électricité, et l’électricité donne au Nautilus la chaleur, la lumière, le
mouvement, la vie en un mot.
— Mais non pas l’air que vous respirez ?
— Oh ! je pourrais fabriquer l’air nécessaire à ma consommation, mais
c’est inutile puisque je remonte à la surface de la mer, quand il me plaît.
Cependant, si l’électricité ne me fournit pas l’air respirable, elle
manoeuvre, du moins, des pompes puissantes qui l’emmagasinent dans des
réservoirs spéciaux, ce qui me permet de prolonger, au besoin, et aussi
longtemps que je le veux, mon séjour dans les couches profondes.
— Capitaine, répondis−je, je me contente d’admirer. Vous avez
évidemment trouvé ce que les hommes trouveront sans doute un jour, la
véritable puissance dynamique de l’électricité.
— Je ne sais s’ils la trouveront, répondit froidement le capitaine Nemo.
Quoi qu’il en soit, vous connaissez déjà la première application que j’ai
faite de ce précieux agent. C’est lui qui nous éclaire avec une égalité, une
continuité que n’a pas la lumière du soleil. Maintenant, regardez cette
horloge ; elle est électrique, et marche avec une régularité qui défie celle
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Tout par l'électricité 102
des meilleurs chronomètres. Je l’ai divisée en vingt−quatre heures, comme
les horloges italiennes, car pour moi, il n’existe ni nuit, ni jour, ni soleil, ni
lune, mais seulement cette lumière factice que j’entraîne jusqu’au fond des
mers ! Voyez, en ce moment, il est dix heures du matin.
— Parfaitement.
— Autre application de l’électricité. Ce cadran, suspendu devant nos yeux,
sert à indiquer la vitesse du Nautilus. Un fil électrique le met en
communication avec l’hélice du loch, et son aiguille m’indique la marche
réelle de l’appareil. Et, tenez, en ce moment, nous filons avec une vitesse
modérée de quinze milles à l’heure.
— C’est merveilleux, répondis−je, et je vois bien, capitaine, que vous avez
eu raison d’employer cet agent, qui est destiné à remplacer le vent, l’eau et
la vapeur.
— Nous n’avons pas fini, monsieur Aronnax, dit le capitaine Nemo en se
levant, et si vous voulez me suivre, nous visiterons l’arrière du Nautilus. »
En effet, je connaissais déjà toute la partie antérieure de ce bateau
sous−marin, dont voici la division exacte, en allant du centre à l’éperon : la
salle à manger de cinq mètres, séparée de la bibliothèque par une cloison
étanche, c’est−à−dire ne pouvant être pénétrée par l’eau, la bibliothèque de
cinq mètres, le grand salon de dix mètres, séparé de la chambre du
capitaine par une seconde cloison étanche, ladite chambre du capitaine de
cinq mètres, la mienne de deux mètres cinquante, et enfin un réservoir
d’air de sept mètres cinquante, qui s’étendait jusqu’à l’étrave. Total,
trente−cinq mètres de longueur. Les cloisons étanches étaient percées de
portes qui se fermaient hermétiquement au moyen d’obturateurs en
caoutchouc, et elles assuraient toute sécurité à bord du Nautilus, au cas où
une voie d’eau se fût déclarée.
Je suivis le capitaine Nemo. à travers les coursives situées en abord, et
j’arrivai au centre du navire. Là, se trouvait une sorte de puits qui s’ouvrait
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Tout par l'électricité 103
entre deux cloisons étanches. Une échelle de fer, cramponnée à la paroi,
conduisait à son extrémité supérieure. Je demandai au capitaine à quel
usage servait cette échelle.
« Elle aboutit au canot, répondit−il.
— Quoi ! vous avez un canot ? répliquai−je, assez étonné.
— Sans doute. Une excellente embarcation, légère et insubmersible, qui
sert à la promenade et à la pêche.
— Mais alors, quand vous voulez vous embarquer, vous êtes forcé de
revenir à la surface de la mer ?
— Aucunement. Ce canot adhère à la partie supérieure de la coque du
Nautilus, et occupe une cavité disposée pour le recevoir. Il est entièrement
ponté, absolument étanche, et retenu par de solides boulons. Cette échelle
conduit à un trou d’homme percé dans la coque du Nautilus, qui
correspond à un trou pareil percé dans le flanc du canot. C’est par cette
double ouverture que je m’introduis dans l’embarcation. On referme l’une,
celle du Nautilus ; je referme l’autre, celle du canot, au moyen de vis de
pression ; je largue les boulons, et l’embarcation remonte avec une
prodigieuse rapidité à la surface de la mer. J’ouvre alors le panneau du
pont, soigneusement clos jusque−là, je mâte, je hisse ma voile ou je prends
mes avirons, et je me promène.
— Mais comment revenez−vous à bord ?
— Je ne reviens pas, monsieur Aronnax, c’est le Nautilus qui revient.
— A vos ordres !
— A mes ordres. Un fil électrique me rattache à lui. Je lance un
télégramme, et cela suffit.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Tout par l'électricité 104
— En effet, dis−je, grisé par ces merveilles, rien n’est plus simple ! »
Après avoir dépassé la cage de l’escalier qui aboutissait à la plate−forme,
je vis une cabine longue de deux mètres, dans laquelle Conseil et Ned
Land, enchantés de leur repas, s’occupaient à le dévorer à belles dents.
Puis, une porte s’ouvrit sur la cuisine longue de trois mètres, située entre
les vastes cambuses du bord.
Là, l’électricité, plus énergique et plus obéissante que le gaz lui−même,
faisait tous les frais de la cuisson. Les fils, arrivant sous les fourneaux,
communiquaient à des éponges de platine une chaleur qui se distribuait et
se maintenait régulièrement. Elle chauffait également des appareils
distillatoires qui, par la vaporisation, fournissaient une excellente eau
potable. Auprès de cette cuisine s’ouvrait une salle de bains,
confortablement disposée, et dont les robinets fournissaient l’eau froide ou
l’eau chaude, à volonté.
A la cuisine succédait le poste de l’équipage, long de cinq mètres. Mais la
porte en était fermée, et je ne pus voir son aménagement, qui m’eût
peut−être fixé sur le nombre d’hommes nécessité par la manoeuvre du
Nautilus.
Au fond s’élevait une quatrième cloison étanche qui séparait ce poste de la
chambre des machines. Une porte s’ouvrit, et je me trouvai dans ce
compartiment où le capitaine Nemo – ingénieur de premier ordre, à coup
sûr – avait disposé ses appareils de locomotion.
Cette chambre des machines, nettement éclairée, ne mesurait pas moins de
vingt mètres en longueur. Elle était naturellement divisée en deux parties ;
la première renfermait les éléments qui produisaient l’électricité. et la
seconde, le mécanisme qui transmettait le mouvement à l’hélice.
Je fus surpris, tout d’abord, de l’odeur sui generis qui emplissait ce
compartiment. Le capitaine Nemo s’aperçut de mon impression.
« Ce sont, me dit−il, quelques dégagements de gaz, produits par l’emploi
du sodium ; mais ce n’est qu’un léger inconvénient. Tous les matins,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Tout par l'électricité 105
d’ailleurs, nous purifions le navire en le ventilant à grand air. »
Cependant, j’examinais avec un intérêt facile à concevoir la machine du
Nautilus.
« Vous le voyez, me dit le capitaine Nemo, j’emploie des éléments
Bunzen, et non des éléments Ruhmkorff. Ceux−ci eussent été impuissants.
Les éléments Bunzen sont peu nombreux, mais forts et grands, ce qui vaut
mieux, expérience faite. L’électricité produite se rend à l’arrière, où elle
agit par des électro−aimants de glande dimension sur un système
particulier de leviers et d’engrenages qui transmettent le mouvement à
l’arbre de l’hélice. Celle−ci. dont le diamètre est de six mètres et le pas de
sept mètres cinquante, peut donner jusqu’à cent vingt tours par seconde.
— Et vous obtenez alors ?
— Une vitesse de cinquante milles à l’heure. »
Il y avait là un mystère, mais je n’insistai pas pour le connaître. Comment
l’électricité pouvait−elle agir avec une telle puissance ? Où cette force
presque illimitée prenait−elle son origine ? Etait−ce dans sa tension
excessive obtenue par des bobines d’une nouvelle sorte ? Était−ce dans sa
transmission qu’un système de leviers inconnus pouvait accroître à
l’infini ? C’est ce que je ne pouvais comprendre.
« Capitaine Nemo, dis−je, je constate les résultats et je ne cherche pas à les
expliquer. J’ai vu le Nautilus manoeuvrer devant l’Abraham−Lincoln, et je
sais à quoi m’en tenir sur sa vitesse. Mais marcher ne suffit pas. Il faut voir
où l’on va ! Il faut pouvoir se diriger à droite, à gauche, en haut, en bas !
Comment atteignez−vous les grandes profondeurs, où vous trouvez une
résistance croissante qui s’évalue par des centaines d’atmosphères ?
Comment remontez−vous à la surface de l’Océan ? Enfin, comment vous
maintenez−vous dans le milieu qui vous convient ? Suis−je indiscret en
vous le demandant ?
— Aucunement, monsieur le professeur, me répondit le capitaine, après
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Tout par l'électricité 106
une légère hésitation. puisque vous ne devez jamais quitter ce bateau
sous−marin. Venez dans le salon. C’est notre véritable cabinet de travail, et
là, vous apprendrez tout ce que vous devez savoir sur le Nautilus ! »

Quelques chiffres
Un instant après, nous étions assis sur un divan du salon, le cigare aux
lèvres. Le capitaine mit sous mes yeux une épure qui donnait les plan,
coupe et élévation du Nautilus. Puis il commença sa description en ces
termes :
« Voici. monsieur Aronnax, les diverses dimensions du bateau qui vous
porte. C’est un cylindre très allongé, à bouts coniques. Il affecte
sensiblement la forme d’un cigare, forme déjà adoptée à Londres dans
plusieurs constructions du même genre. La longueur de ce cylindre. de tête
en tête, est exactement de soixante−dix mètres, et son bau. à sa plus grande
largeur, est de huit mètres. Il n’est donc pas construit tout à fait au dixième
comme vos steamers de grande marche, mais ses lignes sont suffisamment
longues et sa coulée assez prolongée, pour que l’eau déplacée s’échappe
aisément et n’oppose aucun obstacle a sa marche.
« Ces deux dimensions vous permettent d’obtenir par un simple calcul la
surface et le volume du Nautilus. Sa surface comprend mille onze mètres
carrés et quarante−cinq centièmes ; son volume, quinze cents mètres cubes
et deux dixièmes – ce qui revient à dire qu’entièrement immergé, il
déplace ou pèse quinze cents mètres cubes ou tonneaux.
« Lorsque j’ai fait les plans de ce navire destiné à une navigation
sous−marine, j’ai voulu, qu’en équilibre dans l’eau il plongeât des neuf
dixièmes, et qu’il émergeât d’un dixième
seulement. Par conséquent, il ne devait déplacer dans ces conditions que
les neuf dixièmes de son volume, soit treize cent cinquante−six mètres
cubes et quarante−huit centièmes, c’est−à−dire ne peser que ce même
nombre de tonneaux. J’ai donc dû ne pas dépasser ce poids en le
construisant suivant les dimensions sus−dites.
Quelques chiffres 108
« Le Nautilus se compose de deux coques, l’une intérieure, l’autre
extérieure, réunies entre elles par des fers en T qui lui donnent une rigidité
extrême. En effet, grâce à cette disposition cellulaire, il résiste comme un
bloc, comme s’il était plein. Son bordé ne peut céder ; il adhère par
lui−même et non par le serrage des rivets, et l’homogénéité de sa
construction, due au parfait assemblage des matériaux, lui permet de défier
les mers les plus violentes.
« Ces deux coques sont fabriquées en tôle d’acier dont la densité par
rapport à l’eau est de sept, huit dixièmes. La première n’a pas moins de
cinq centimètres d’épaisseur, et pèse trois cent quatre−vingt−quatorze
tonneaux quatre−vingt−seize centièmes. La seconde enveloppe, la quille,
haute de cinquante centimètres et large de vingt−cinq, pesant, à elle seule,
soixante−deux tonneaux, la machine, le lest, les divers accessoires et
aménagements, les cloisons et les étrésillons intérieurs, ont un poids de
neuf cent soixante et un tonneaux soixante−deux centièmes, qui, ajoutés
aux trois cent quatre−vingt−quatorze tonneaux et quatre−vingt−seize
centièmes, forment le total exigé de treize cent cinquante−six tonneaux et
quarante−huit centièmes. Est−ce entendu ?
— C’est entendu, répondis−je.
— Donc, reprit le capitaine, lorsque le Nautilus se trouve à flot dans ces
conditions, il émerge d’un dixième. Or, si j’ai disposé des réservoirs d’une
capacité égale à ce dixième, soit d’une contenance de cent cinquante
tonneaux et soixante−douze centièmes, et si je les remplis d’eau, le bateau
déplaçant alors quinze cent sept tonneaux, ou les pesant, sera
complètement immergé. C’est ce qui arrive, monsieur le professeur. Ces
réservoirs existent en abord dans les parties inférieures du Nautilus.
J’ouvre des robinets, ils se remplissent, et le bateau s’enfonçant vient
affleurer la surface de l’eau.
— Bien, capitaine, mais nous arrivons alors à la véritable difficulté. Que
vous puissiez affleurer la surface de l’Océan, je le comprends. Mais plus
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 109
bas, en plongeant au−dessous de cette surface, votre appareil sous−marin
ne va−t−il pas rencontrer une pression et par conséquent subir une poussée
de bas en haut qui doit être évaluée à une atmosphère par trente pieds
d’eau, soit environ un kilogramme par centimètre carré ?
— Parfaitement, monsieur.
— Donc, à moins que vous ne remplissiez le Nautilus en entier, je ne vois
pas comment vous pouvez l’entraîner au sein des masses liquides.
— Monsieur le professeur, répondit le capitaine Nemo, il ne faut pas
confondre la statique avec la dynamique, sans quoi l’on s’expose à de
graves erreurs. Il y a très peu de travail à dépenser pour atteindre les basses
régions de l’Océan, car les corps ont une tendance à devenir « fondriers ».
Suivez mon raisonnement.
— Je vous écoute, capitaine.
— Lorsque j’ai voulu déterminer l’accroissement de poids qu’il faut
donner au Nautilus pour l’immerger, je n’ai eu à me préoccuper que de la
réduction du volume que l’eau de mer éprouve à mesure que ses couches
deviennent de plus en plus profondes.
— C’est évident, répondis−je.
— Or, si l’eau n’est pas absolument incompressible, elle est, du moins, très
peu compressible. En effet, d’après les calculs les plus récents, cette
réduction n’est que de quatre cent trente−six dix millionièmes par
atmosphère, ou par chaque trente pieds de profondeur. S’agit−il d’aller à
mille mètres, je tiens compte alors de la réduction du volume sous une
pression équivalente à celle d’une colonne d’eau de mille mètres,
c’est−à−dire sous une pression de cent atmosphères. Cette réduction sera
alors de quatre cent trente−six cent millièmes. Je devrai donc accroître le
poids de façon à peser quinze cent treize tonneaux soixante−dix−sept
centièmes, au lieu de quinze cent sept tonneaux deux dixièmes.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 110
L’augmentation ne sera conséquemment que de six tonneaux
cinquante−sept centièmes.
— Seulement ?
— Seulement, monsieur Aronnax, et le calcul est facile à vérifier. Or, j’ai
des réservoirs supplémentaires capables d’embarquer cent tonneaux. Je
puis donc descendre à des profondeurs considérables. Lorsque je veux
remonter à la surface et l’affleurer, il me suffit de chasser cette eau, et de
vider entièrement tous les réservoirs, si je désire que le Nautilus émerge du
dixième de sa capacité totale. »
A ces raisonnements appuyés sur des chiffres, je n’avais rien à objecter.
« J’admets vos calculs, capitaine, répondis−je, et j’aurais mauvaise grâce à
les contester, puisque l’expérience leur donne raison chaque jour. Mais je
pressens actuellement en présence une difficulté réelle.
— Laquelle, monsieur ?
— Lorsque vous êtes par mille mètres de profondeur, les parois du
Nautilus supportent une pression de cent atmosphères. Si donc, à ce
moment, vous voulez vider les réservoirs supplémentaires pour alléger
votre bateau et remonter à la surface, il faut que les pompes vainquent cette
pression de cent atmosphères, qui est de cent kilogrammes par centimètre
carré. De là une puissance...
— Que l’électricité seule pouvait me donner, se hâta de dire le capitaine
Nemo. Je vous répète, monsieur, que le pouvoir dynamique de mes
machines est à peu près infini. Les pompes du Nautilus ont une force
prodigieuse, et vous avez dû le voir, quand leurs colonnes d’eau se sont
précipitées comme un torrent sur l’Abraham−Lincoln. D’ailleurs, je ne me
sers des réservoirs supplémentaires que pour atteindre des profondeurs
moyennes de quinze cent à deux mille mètres, et cela dans le but de
ménager mes appareils. Aussi, lorsque la fantaisie me prend de visiter les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 111
profondeurs de l’Océan à deux ou trois lieues au−dessous de sa surface,
j’emploie des manoeuvres plus longues, mais non moins infaillibles.
— Lesquelles, capitaine ? demandai−je.
— Ceci m’amène naturellement à vous dire comment se manoeuvre le
Nautilus.
— Je suis impatient de l’apprendre.
— Pour gouverner ce bateau sur tribord, sur bâbord, pour évoluer, en un
mot, suivant un plan horizontal, je me sers d’un gouvernail ordinaire à
large safran, fixé sur l’arrière de l’étambot, et qu’une roue et des palans
font agir. Mais je puis aussi mouvoir le Nautilus de bas en haut et de haut
en bas, dans un plan vertical, au moyen de deux plans inclinés, attachés à
ses flancs sur son centre de flottaison, plans mobiles, aptes à prendre toutes
les positions, et qui se manoeuvrent de l’intérieur au moyen de leviers
puissants. Ces plans sont−ils maintenus parallèles au bateau, celui−ci se
meut horizontalement. Sont−ils inclinés, le Nautilus, suivant la disposition
de cette inclinaison et sous la poussée de son hélice, ou s’enfonce suivant
une diagonale aussi allongée qu’il me convient, ou remonte suivant cette
diagonale. Et même, si je veux revenir plus rapidement à la surface,
j’embraye l’hélice, et la pression des eaux fait remonter verticalement le
Nautilus comme un ballon qui, gonflé d’hydrogène, s’élève rapidement
dans les airs.
— Bravo ! capitaine, m’écriais−je. Mais comment le timonier peut−il
suivre la route que vous lui donnez au milieu des eaux ?
— Le timonier est placé dans une cage vitrée, qui fait saillie à la partie
supérieure de la coque du Nautilus, et que garnissent des verres
lenticulaires.
— Des verres capables de résister à de telles pressions ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 112
— Parfaitement. Le cristal, fragile au choc, offre cependant une résistance
considérable. Dans des expériences de pêche à la lumière électrique faites
en 1864, au milieu des mers du Nord, on a vu des plaques de cette matière,
sous une épaisseur de sept millimètres seulement, résister à une pression de
seize atmosphères, tout en laissant passer de puissants rayons calorifiques
qui lui répartissaient inégalement la chaleur. Or, les verres dont je me sers
n’ont pas moins de vingt et un centimètres à leur centre, c’est−à−dire
trente fois cette épaisseur.
— Admis, capitaine Nemo ; mais enfin, pour voir, il faut que la lumière
chasse les ténèbres, et je me demande comment au milieu de l’obscurité
des eaux...
— En arrière de la cage du timonier est placé un puissant réflecteur
électrique, dont les rayons illuminent la mer à un demi−mille de distance.
— Ah ! bravo, trois fois bravo ! capitaine. Je m’explique maintenant cette
phosphorescence du prétendu narval, qui a tant intrigué les savants ! A ce
propos, je vous demanderai si l’abordage du Nautilus et du Scotia, qui a eu
un si grand retentissement, a été le résultat d’une rencontre fortuite ?
— Purement fortuite, monsieur. Je naviguais à deux mètres au−dessous de
la surface des eaux, quand le choc s’est produit. J’ai d’ailleurs vu qu’il
n’avait eu aucun résultat fâcheux.
— Aucun, monsieur. Mais quant à votre rencontre avec
l’Abraham−Lincoln ? ...
— Monsieur le professeur, j’en suis fâché pour l’un des meilleurs navires
de cette brave marine américaine mais on m’attaquait et j’ai dû me
défendre ! Je me suis contenté, toutefois, de mettre la frégate hors d’état de
me nuire – elle ne sera pas gênée de réparer ses avaries au port le plus
prochain.
— Ah ! commandant, m’écriai−je avec conviction, c’est vraiment un
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 113
merveilleux bateau que votre Nautilus !
— Oui, monsieur le professeur, répondit avec une véritable émotion le
capitaine Nemo, et je l’aime comme la chair de ma chair ! Si tout est
danger sur un de vos navires soumis aux hasards de l’Océan, si sur cette
mer, la première impression est le sentiment de l’abîme, comme l’a si bien
dit le Hollandais Jansen, au−dessous et à bord du Nautilus, le coeur de
l’homme n’a plus rien à redouter. Pas de déformation à craindre, car la
double coque de ce bateau a la rigidité du fer ; pas de gréement que le
roulis ou le tangage fatiguent ; pas de voiles que le vent emporte ; pas de
chaudières que la vapeur déchire ; pas d’incendie à redouter, puisque cet
appareil est fait de tôle et non de bois ; pas de charbon qui s’épuise,
puisque l’électricité est son agent mécanique ; pas de rencontre à redouter,
puisqu’il est seul à naviguer dans les eaux profondes ; pas de tempête à
braver, puisqu’il trouve à quelques mètres au−dessous des eaux l’absolue
tranquillité ! Voilà, monsieur. Voilà le navire par excellence ! Et s’il est
vrai que l’ingénieur ait plus de confiance dans le bâtiment que le
constructeur, et le constructeur plus que le capitaine lui−même, comprenez
donc avec quel abandon je me fie à mon Nautilus, puisque j’en suis tout à
la fois le capitaine, le constructeur et l’ingénieur ! »
Le capitaine Nemo parlait avec une éloquence entraînante. Le feu de son
regard, la passion de son geste, le transfiguraient. Oui ! il aimait son navire
comme un père aime son enfant !
Mais une question, indiscrète peut−être, se posait naturellement, et je ne
pus me retenir de la lui faire.
« Vous êtes donc ingénieur, capitaine Nemo ?
— Oui, monsieur le professeur, me répondit−il, j’ai étudié à Londres, à
Paris, à New York, du temps que j’étais un habitant des continents de la
terre.
— Mais comment avez−vous pu construire, en secret, cet admirable
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 114
Nautilus ?
— Chacun de ses morceaux, monsieur Aronnax, m’est arrivé d’un point
différent du globe, et sous une destination déguisée. Sa quille a été forgée
au Creusot, son arbre d’hélice chez Pen et C°, de Londres, les plaques de
tôle de sa coque chez Leard, de Liverpool, son hélice chez Scott, de
Glasgow. Ses réservoirs ont été fabriqués par Cail et Co, de Paris, sa
machine par Krupp, en Prusse, son éperon dans les ateliers de Motala, en
Suède, ses instruments de précision chez Hart frères, de New York, etc. , et
chacun de ces fournisseurs a reçu mes plans sous des noms divers.
— Mais, repris−je, ces morceaux ainsi fabriqués, il a fallu les monter, les
ajuster ?
— Monsieur le professeur, j’avais établi mes ateliers sur un îlot désert, en
plein Océan. Là, mes ouvriers c’est−à−dire mes braves compagnons que
j’ai instruits et formés, et moi, nous avons achevé notre Nautilus. Puis,
l’opération terminée, le feu a détruit toute trace de notre passage sur cet
îlot que j’aurais fait sauter, si je l’avais pu.
— Alors il m’est permis de croire que le prix de revient de ce bâtiment est
excessif ?
— Monsieur Aronnax, un navire en fer coûte onze cent vingt−cinq francs
par tonneau. Or, le Nautilus en jauge quinze cents. Il revient donc à seize
cent quatre−vingt−sept mille francs, soit deux millions y compris son
aménagement, soit quatre ou cinq millions avec les oeuvres d’art et les
collections qu’il renferme.
— Une dernière question, capitaine Nemo.
— Faites, monsieur le professeur.
— Vous êtes donc riche ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 115
— Riche à l’infini, monsieur, et je pourrais, sans me gêner, payer les dix
milliards de dettes de la France ! »
Je regardai fixement le bizarre personnage qui me parlait ainsi. Abusait−il
de ma crédulité ? L’avenir devait me l’apprendre.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques chiffres 116
Le fleuve noir
La portion du globe terrestre occupée par les eaux est évaluée à trois
millions huit cent trente−deux milles cinq cent cinquante−huit myriamètres
carrés, soit plus de trente−huit millions d’hectares. Cette masse liquide
comprend deux milliards deux cent cinquante millions de milles cubes, et
formerait une sphère d’un diamètre de soixante lieues dont le poids serait
de trois quintillions de tonneaux. Et, pour comprendre ce nombre, il faut se
dire que le quintillion est au milliard ce que le milliard est à l’unité,
c’est−à−dire qu’il y a autant de milliards dans un quintillion que d’unités
dans un milliard. Or, cette masse liquide, c’est à peu près la quantité d’eau
que verseraient tous les fleuves de la terre pendant quarante mille ans.
Durant les époques géologiques, à la période du feu succéda la période de
l’eau. L’Océan fut d’abord universel. Puis, peu à peu, dans les temps
siluriens, des sommets de montagnes apparurent, des îles émergèrent,
disparurent sous des déluges partiels, se montrèrent à nouveau, se
soudèrent. formèrent des continents et enfin les terres se fixèrent
géographiquement telles que nous les voyons. Le solide avait conquis sur
le liquide trente−sept millions six cent cinquante−sept milles carrés, soit
douze mille neuf cent seize millions d’hectares.
La configuration des continents permet de diviser les eaux en cinq grandes
parties : l’Océan glacial arctique, l’Océan glacial antarctique, l’Océan
indien, l’Océan atlantique, l’Océan pacifique.
L’Océan pacifique s’étend du nord au sud entre les deux cercles polaires,
et de l’ouest a l’est entre l’Asie et l’Amérique sur une étendue de cent
quarante−cinq degrés en longitude. C’est la plus tranquille des mers ; ses
courants sont larges et lents, ses marées médiocres, ses pluies abondantes.
Tel était l’Océan que ma destinée m’appelait d’abord à parcourir dans les
plus étranges conditions.
Le fleuve noir 117
« Monsieur le professeur, me dit le capitaine Nemo, nous allons, si vous le
voulez bien, relever exactement notre position, et fixer le point de départ
de ce voyage. Il est midi moins le quart. Je vais remonter à la surface des
eaux. »
Le capitaine pressa trois fois un timbre électrique. Les pompes
commencèrent à chasser l’eau des réservoirs ; l’aiguille du manomètre
marqua par les différentes pressions le mouvement ascensionnel du
Nautilus, puis elle s’arrêta.
« Nous sommes arrivés », dit le capitaine.
Je me rendis à l’escalier central qui aboutissait à la plate−forme. Je gravis
les marches de métal, et, par les panneaux ouverts, j’arrivai sur la partie
supérieure du Nautilus.
La plate−forme émergeait de quatre−vingts centimètres seulement. L’avant
et l’arrière du Nautilus présentaient cette disposition fusiforme qui le
faisait justement comparer à un long cigare. Je remarquai que ses plaques
de tôles, imbriquées légèrement, ressemblaient aux écailles qui revêtent le
corps des grands reptiles terrestres. Je m’expliquai donc très naturellement
que, malgré les meilleures lunettes, ce bateau eût toujours été pris pour un
animal marin.
Vers le milieu de la plate−forme, le canot, à demi−engagé dans la coque du
navire, formait une légère extumescence. En avant et en arrière s’élevaient
deux cages de hauteur médiocre, à parois inclinées, et en partie fermées par
d’épais verres lenticulaires : l’une destinée au timonier qui dirigeait le
Nautilus, l’autre où brillait le puissant fanal électrique qui éclairait sa
route.
La mer était magnifique, le ciel pur. A peine si le long véhicule ressentait
les larges ondulations de l’Océan. Une légère brise de l’est ridait la surface
des eaux. L’horizon, dégagé de brumes, se prêtait aux meilleures
observations.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 118
Nous n’avions rien en vue. Pas un écueil, pas un îlot. Plus
d’Abraham−Lincoln. L’immensité déserte.
Le capitaine Nemo, muni de son sextant, prit la hauteur du soleil, qui
devait lui donner sa latitude. Il attendit pendant quelques minutes que
l’astre vint affleurer le bord de l’horizon. Tandis qu’il observait, pas un de
ses muscles ne tressaillait, et l’instrument n’eût pas été plus immobile dans
une main de marbre.
« Midi, dit−il. Monsieur le professeur, quand vous voudrez ? ... »
Je jetai un dernier regard sur cette mer un peu jaunâtre des atterrages
japonais, et je redescendis au grand salon.
Là, le capitaine fit son point et calcula chronométriquement sa longitude,
qu’il contrôla par de précédentes observations d’angle horaires. Puis il me
dit :
« Monsieur Aronnax, nous sommes par cent trente−sept degrés et quinze
minutes de longitude à l’ouest...
— De quel méridien ? demandai−je vivement, espérant que la réponse du
capitaine m’indiquerait peut−être sa nationalité.
— Monsieur, me répondit−il, j’ai divers chronomètres réglés sur les
méridiens de Paris, de Greenwich et de Washington. Mais, en votre
honneur je me servirai de celui de Paris. »
Cette réponse ne m’apprenait rien. Je m’inclinai, et le commandant reprit :
« Trente−sept degrés et quinze minutes de longitude à l’ouest du méridien
de Paris, et par trente degrés et sept minutes de latitude nord, c’est−à−dire
à trois cents milles environ des côtes du Japon. C’est aujourd’hui 8
novembre, à midi, que commence notre voyage d’exploration sous les
eaux.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 119
— Dieu nous garde ! répondis−je.
— Et maintenant, monsieur le professeur, ajouta le capitaine, je vous laisse
à vos études. J’ai donné la route à l’est−nord−est par cinquante mètres de
profondeur. Voici des cartes à grands points, où vous pourrez la suivre. Le
salon est à votre disposition, et je vous demande la permission de me
retirer. »
Le capitaine Nemo me salua. Je restai seul, absorbé dans mes pensées.
Toutes se portaient sur ce commandant du Nautilus. Saurais−je jamais à
quelle nation appartenait cet homme étrange qui se vantait de n’appartenir
à aucune ? Cette haine qu’il avait vouée à l’humanité, cette haine qui
cherchait peut−être des vengeances terribles, qui l’avait provoquée ?
Etait−il un de ces savants méconnus, un de ces génies « auxquels on a fait
du chagrin », suivant l’expression de Conseil, un Galilée moderne, ou bien
un de ces hommes de science comme l’Américain Maury, dont la carrière a
été brisée par des révolutions politiques ? Je ne pouvais encore le dire. Moi
que le hasard venait de jeter à son bord, moi dont il tenait la vie entre les
mains, il m’accueillait froidement, mais hospitalièrement. Seulement, il
n’avait jamais pris la main que je lui tendais. Il ne m’avait jamais tendu la
sienne.
Une heure entière, je demeurai plongé dans ces réflexions, cherchant à
percer ce mystère si intéressant pour moi. Puis mes regards se fixèrent sur
le vaste planisphère étalé sur la table, et je plaçai le doigt sur le point
même où se croisaient la longitude et la latitude observées.
La mer a ses fleuves comme les continents. Ce sont des courants spéciaux,
reconnaissables à leur température, à leur couleur, et dont le plus
remarquable est connu sous le nom de courant du Gulf Stream. La science
a déterminé, sur le globe, la direction de cinq courants principaux : un dans
l’Atlantique nord, un second dans l’Atlantique sud, un troisième dans le
Pacifique nord, un quatrième dans le Pacifique sud, et un cinquième dans
l’Océan indien sud. Il est même probable qu’un sixième courant existait
autrefois dans l’Océan indien nord, lorsque les mers Caspienne et d’Aral,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 120
réunies aux grands lacs de l’Asie, ne formaient qu’une seule et même
étendue d’eau.
Or, au point indiqué sur le planisphère, se déroulait l’un de ces courants, le
Kuro−Scivo des Japonais, le Fleuve−Noir, qui, sorti du golfe du Bengale
où le chauffent les rayons perpendiculaires du soleil des Tropiques,
traverse le détroit de Malacca, prolonge la côte d’Asie, s’arrondit dans le
Pacifique nord jusqu’aux îles Aléoutiennes, charriant des troncs de
camphriers et autres produits indigènes, et tranchant par le pur indigo de
ses eaux chaudes avec les flots de l’Océan. C’est ce courant que le
Nautilus allait parcourir. Je le suivais du regard, je le voyais se perdre dans
l’immensité du Pacifique, et je me sentais entraîner avec lui, quand Ned
Land et Conseil apparurent à la porte du salon.
Mes deux braves compagnons restèrent pétrifiés à la vue des merveilles
entassées devant leurs yeux.
« Où sommes−nous ? où sommes−nous ? s’écria le Canadien. Au muséum
de Québec ?
— S’il plaît à monsieur, répliqua Conseil, ce serait plutôt à l’hôtel du
Sommerard !
— Mes amis, répondis−je en leur faisant signe d’entrer, vous n’êtes ni au
Canada ni en France, mais bien à bord du Nautilus, et à cinquante mètres
au−dessous du niveau de la mer.
— Il faut croire monsieur, puisque monsieur l’affirme. répliqua Conseil ;
mais franchement, ce salon est fait pour étonner même un Flamand comme
moi.
— Etonne−toi, mon ami. et regarde, car, pour un classificateur de ta force.
il y a de quoi travailler ici. »
Je n’avais pas besoin d’encourager Conseil. Le brave garçon, penché sur
les vitrines. murmurait déjà des mots de la langue des naturalistes : classe
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 121
des Gastéropodes, famille des Buccinoïdes, genre des Porcelaines, espèces
des Cypr÷a Madagascariensis, etc.
Pendant ce temps, Ned Land, assez peu conchyliologue, m’interrogeait sur
mon entrevue avec le capitaine Nemo. Avais−je découvert qui il était, d’où
il venait, où il allait, vers quelles profondeurs il nous entraînait ? Enfin
mille questions auxquelles je n’avais pas le temps de répondre.
Je lui appris tout ce que je savais, ou plutôt, tout ce que je ne savais pas, et
je lui demandai ce qu’il avait entendu ou vu de son côté.
« Rien vu, rien entendu ! répondit le Canadien. Je n’ai pas même aperçu
l’équipage de ce bateau. Est−ce que, par hasard, il serait électrique aussi,
lui ?
— Electrique !
— Par ma foi ! on serait tenté de le croire. Mais vous, monsieur Aronnax,
demanda Ned Land, qui avait toujours
son idée, vous ne pouvez me dire combien d’hommes il y a à bord ? Dix,
vingt, cinquante, cent ?
— Je ne saurais vous répondre, maître Land. D’ailleurs,croyez−moi,
abandonnez, pour le moment, cette idée de vous emparer du Nautilus ou de
le fuir. Ce bateau est un des chefs−d’oeuvre de l’industrie moderne, et je
regretterais de ne pas l’avoir vu ! Bien des gens accepteraient la situation
qui nous est faite, ne fût−ce que pour se promener à travers ces merveilles.
Ainsi. tenez−vous tranquille, et tâchons de voir ce qui se passe autour de
nous.
— Voir ! s’écria le harponneur, mais on ne voit rien, on ne verra rien de
cette prison de tôle ! Nous marchons, nous naviguons en aveugles... »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 122
— Ned Land prononçait ces derniers mots, quand l’obscurité se fit
subitement, mais une obscurité absolue. Le plafond lumineux s’éteignit, et
si rapidement, que mes yeux en éprouvèrent une impression douloureuse,
analogue à celle que produit le passage contraire des profondes ténèbres à
la plus éclatante lumière.
Nous étions restés muets, ne remuant pas, ne sachant quelle surprise,
agréable ou désagréable, nous attendait. Mais un glissement se fit entendre.
On eût dit que des panneaux se manoeuvraient sur les flancs du Nautilus.
« C’est la fin de la fin ! dit Ned Land.
— Ordre des Hydroméduses ! » murmura Conseil.
Soudain, le jour se fit de chaque côté du salon, à travers deux ouvertures
oblongues. Les masses liquides apparurent vivement éclairées par les
effluences électriques. Deux plaques de cristal nous séparaient de la mer.
Je frémis, d’abord, à la pensée que cette fragile paroi pouvait se briser ;
mais de fortes armatures de cuivre la maintenaient et lui donnaient une
résistance presque infinie.
La mer était distinctement visible dans un rayon d’un mille autour du
Nautilus. Quel spectacle ! Quelle plume le pourrait décrire ! Qui saurait
peindre les effets de la lumière à travers ces nappes transparentes, et la
douceur de ses dégradations successives jusqu’aux couchés inférieures et
supérieures de l’Océan !
On connaît la diaphanéité de la mer. On sait que sa limpidité l’emporte sur
celle de l’eau de roche. Les substances minérales et organiques, qu’elle
tient en suspension, accroissent même sa transparence. Dans certaines
parties de l’Océan, aux Antilles, cent quarante−cinq mètres d’eau laissent
apercevoir le lit de sable avec une surprenante netteté, et la force de
pénétration des rayons solaires ne paraît s’arrêter qu’à une profondeur de
trois cents mètres. Mais, dans ce milieu fluide que parcourait le Nautilus,
l’éclat électrique se produisait au sein même des ondes. Ce n’était plus de
l’eau lumineuse, mais de la lumière liquide.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 123
Si l’on admet l’hypothèse d’Erhemberg, qui croit à une illumination
phosphorescente des fonds sous−marins, la nature a certainement réservé
pour les habitants de la mer l’un de ses plus prodigieux spectacles, et j’en
pouvais juger ici par les mille jeux de cette lumière. De chaque côté,
j’avais une fenêtre ouverte sur ces abîmes inexplorés. L’obscurité du salon
faisait valoir la clarté extérieure, et nous regardions comme si ce pur cristal
eût été la vitre d’un immense aquarium.
Le Nautilus ne semblait pas bouger. C’est que les points de repère
manquaient. Parfois, cependant, les lignes d’eau, divisées par son éperon,
filaient devant nos regards avec une vitesse excessive.
Emerveillés, nous étions accoudés devant ces vitrines, et nul de nous
n’avait encore rompu ce silence de stupéfaction, quand Conseil dit :
« Vous vouliez voir. ami Ned, eh bien, vous voyez !
— Curieux ! curieux ! faisait le Canadien – qui oubliant ses colères et ses
projets d’évasion, subissait une attraction irrésistible – et l’on viendrait de
plus loin pour admirer ce spectacle !
— Ah ! m’écriai−je, je comprends la vie de cet homme ! Il s’est fait un
monde à part qui lui réserve ses plus étonnantes merveilles !
— Mais les poissons ? fit observer le Canadien. Je ne vois pas de
poissons !
— Que vous importe, ami Ned, répondit Conseil, puisque vous ne les
connaissez pas.
— Moi ! un pêcheur ! s’écria Ned Land.
Et sur ce sujet, une discussion s’éleva entre les deux amis, car ils
connaissaient les poissons, mais chacun d’une façon très différente.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 124
Tout le monde sait que les poissons forment la quatrième et dernière classe
de l’embranchement des vertébrés. On les a très justement définis : « des
vertébrés à circulation double et à sang froid, respirant par des branchies et
destinés à vivre dans l’eau ». Ils composent deux séries distinctes : la série
des poissons osseux. c’est−à−dire ceux dont l’épine dorsale est faite de
vertèbres osseuses, et les poissons cartilagineux, c’est−à−dire ceux dont
l’épine dorsale est faite de vertèbres cartilagineuses.
Le Canadien connaissait peut−être cette distinction, mais Conseil en savait
bien davantage, et maintenant, lié d’amitié avec Ned. il ne pouvait
admettre qu’il fût moins instruit que lui. Aussi lui dit−il :
« Ami Ned, vous êtes un tueur de poissons, un très habile pêcheur. Vous
avez pris un grand nombre de ces intéressants animaux. Mais je gagerais
que vous ne savez pas comment on les classe.
— Si. répondit sérieusement le harponneur. On les classe en poissons qui
se mangent et en poissons qui ne se mangent pas !
— Voilà une distinction de gourmand, répondit Conseil.
Mais dites−moi si vous connaissez la différence qui existe entre les
poissons osseux et les poissons cartilagineux ?
— Peut−être bien, Conseil.
— Et la subdivision de ces deux grandes classes ?
— Je ne m’en doute pas, répondit le Canadien.
— Eh bien, ami Ned, écoutez et retenez ! Les poissons osseux se
subdivisent en six ordres : Primo. Les acanthoptérygiens, dont la mâchoire
supérieure est complète, mobile, et dont les branchies affectent la forme
d’un peigne. Cet ordre comprend quinze familles, c’est−à−dire les trois
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 125
quarts des poissons connus. Type : la perche commune.
— Assez bonne à manger, répondit Ned Land.
— Secundo, reprit Conseil, les abdominaux, qui ont les nageoires ventrales
suspendues sous l’abdomen et en arrière des pectorales, sans être attachées
aux os de l’épaule – ordre qui se divise en cinq familles, et qui comprend
la plus grande partie des poissons d’eau douce. Type : la carpe, le brochet.
— Peuh ! fit le Canadien avec un certain mépris, des poissons d’eau
douce !
— Tertio, dit Conseil, les subrachiens, dont les ventrales sont attachées
sous les pectorales et immédiatement suspendues aux os de l’épaule. Cet
ordre contient quatre familles. Type : plies, limandes, turbots, barbues,
soles, etc.
— Excellent ! excellent ! s’écriait le harponneur, qui ne voulait considérer
les poissons qu’au point de vue comestible.
— Quarto, reprit Conseil, sans se démonter, les apodes, au corps allongé,
dépourvus de nageoires ventrales, et revêtus d’une peau épaisse et souvent
gluante ordre qui ne comprend qu’une famille. Type : l’anguille, le
gymnote.
— Médiocre ! médiocre ! répondit Ned Land.
— Quinto, dit Conseil, les lophobranches, qui ont les mâchoires complètes
et libres, mais dont les branchies sont formées de petites houppes.
disposées par paires le long des arcs branchiaux. Cet ordre ne compte
qu’une famille. Type : les hippocampes, les pégases dragons.
— Mauvais ! mauvais ! répliqua le harponneur.
— Sexto, enfin, dit Conseil, les plectognathes, dont l’os maxillaire est
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 126
attaché fixement sur le côte de l’intermaxillaire qui forme la mâchoire, et
dont l’arcade palatine s’engrène par suture avec le crâne, ce qui la rend
immobile ordre qui manque de vraies ventrales, et qui se compose de deux
familles. Types : les tétrodons, les poissons−lunes.
— Bons à déshonorer une chaudière ! s’écria le Canadien.
— Avez−vous compris, ami Ned ? demanda le savant Conseil.
— Pas le moins du monde, ami Conseil, répondit le harponneur. Mais allez
toujours, car vous êtes très intéressant.
— Quant aux poissons cartilagineux, reprit imperturbablement Conseil, ils
ne comprennent que trois ordres.
— Tant mieux, fit Ned.
— Primo, les cyclostomes, dont les mâchoires sont soudées en un anneau
mobile, et dont les branchies s’ouvrent par des trous nombreux – ordre ne
comprenant qu’une seule famille. Type : la lamproie.
— Faut l’aimer. répondit Ned Land.
— Secundo, les sélaciens, avec branchies semblables à celles des
cyclostomes, mais dont la mâchoire inférieure est mobile. Cet ordre, qui
est le plus important de la classe, comprend deux familles. Types : la raie
et les squales.
— Quoi ! s’écria Ned, des raies et des requins dans le même ordre ! Eh
bien, ami Conseil, dans l’intérêt des raies, je ne vous conseille pas de les
mettre ensemble dans le même bocal !
— Tertio, répondit Conseil, les sturioniens, dont les branchies sont
ouvertes, comme à l’ordinaire, par une seule fente garnie d’un opercule
ordre qui comprend quatre genres. Type : l’esturgeon.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 127
— Ah ! ami Conseil, vous avez gardé le meilleur pour la fin à mon avis, du
moins. Et c’est tout ?
— Oui, mon brave Ned, répondit Conseil, et remarquez que quand on sait
cela, on ne sait rien encore. car les familles se subdivisent en genres, en
sous−genres. en espèces, en variétés...
— Eh bien. ami Conseil, dit le harponneur, se penchant sur la vitre du
panneau, voici des variétés qui passent !
— Oui ! des poissons, s’écria Conseil. On se croirait devant un aquarium !
— Non, répondis−je, car l’aquarium n’est qu’une cage, et ces poissons−là
sont libres comme l’oiseau dans l’air.
— Eh bien, ami Conseil, nommez−les donc, nommez−les donc ! disait Ned
Land.
— Moi, répondit Conseil, je n’en suis pas capable ! Cela regarde mon
maître ! »
Et en effet, le digne garçon. classificateur enragé, n’était point un
naturaliste, et je ne sais pas s’il aurait distingué un thon d’une bonite. En
un mot, le contraire du Canadien, qui nommait tous ces poissons sans
hésiter.
— Un baliste, avais−je dit.
— Et un baliste chinois ! répondait Ned Land.
— Genre des balistes, famille des sclérodermes, ordre des plectognathes ».
murmurait Conseil.
Décidément, à eux deux, Ned et Conseil auraient fait un naturaliste
distingué.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 128
Le Canadien ne s’était pas trompé. Une troupe de balistes, à corps
comprimé. à peau grenue, armés d’un aiguillon sur leur dorsale, se jouaient
autour du Nautilus, et agitaient les quatre rangées de piquants qui hérissent
chaque côté de leur queue. Rien de plus admirable que leur enveloppe,
grise par−dessus, blanche par−dessous dont les taches d’or scintillaient
dans le sombre remous des lames. Entre eux ondulaient des raies, comme
une nappe abandonnée aux vents. et parmi elles, j’aperçus, à ma grande
joie, cette raie chinoise, jaunâtre à sa partie supérieure, rose tendre sous le
ventre et munie de trois aiguillons en arrière de son oeil : espèce rare, et
même douteuse au temps de Lacépède, qui ne l’avait jamais vue que dans
un recueil de dessins japonais.
Pendant deux heures toute une armée aquatique fit escorte au Nautilus. Au
milieu de leurs jeux, de leurs bonds, tandis qu’ils rivalisaient de beauté,
d’éclat et de vitesse, je distinguai le labre vert, le mulle barberin, marqué
d’une double raie noire. Le gobie éléotre, à caudale arrondie, blanc de
couleur et tacheté de violet sur le dos, le scombre japonais, admirable
maquereau de ces mers, au corps bleu et à la tête argentée, de brillants
azurors dont le nom seul emporte toute description des spares rayés, aux
nageoires variées de bleu et de jaune, des spares fascés, relevés d’une
bande noire sur leur caudale, des spares zonéphores élégamment corsetés
dans leurs six ceintures, des aulostones, véritables bouches en flûte ou
bécasses de mer, dont quelques échantillons atteignaient une longueur d’un
mètre, des salamandres du Japon, des murènes échidnées, longs serpents
de six pieds, aux yeux vifs et petits, et à la vaste bouche hérissée de dents,
etc.
Notre admiration se maintenait toujours au plus haut point. Nos
interjections ne tarissaient pas. Ned nommait les poissons, Conseil les
classait, moi, je m’extasiais devant la vivacité de leurs allures et la beauté
de leurs formes. Jamais il ne m’avait été donné de surprendre ces animaux
vivants, et libres dans leur élément naturel.
Je ne citerai pas toutes les variétés qui passèrent ainsi devant nos yeux
éblouis, toute cette collection des mers du Japon et de la Chine. Ces
poissons accouraient, plus nombreux que les oiseaux dans l’air, attirés sans
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 129
doute par l’éclatant foyer de lumière électrique.
Subitement, le jour se fit dans le salon. Les panneaux de tôle se
refermèrent. L’enchanteresse vision disparut. Mais longtemps, je rêvai
encore, jusqu’au moment où mes regards se fixèrent sur les instruments
suspendus aux parois. La boussole montrait toujours la direction au
nord−nord−est, le manomètre indiquait une pression de cinq atmosphères
correspondant à une profondeur de cinquante mètres, et le loch électrique
donnait une marche de quinze milles à l’heure.
J’attendais le capitaine Nemo. Mais il ne parut pas. L’horloge marquait
cinq heures.
Ned Land et Conseil retournèrent à leur cabine. Moi, je regagnai ma
chambre. Mon dîner s’y trouvait préparé. Il se composait d’une soupe à la
tortue faite des carets les plus délicats, d’un surmulet à chair blanche. un
peu feuilletée, dont le foie préparé à part fit un manger délicieux, et de
filets de cette viande de l’holocante empereur, dont la saveur me parut
supérieure à celle du saumon.
Je passai la soirée à lire, à écrire, à penser. Puis, le sommeil me gagnant, je
m’étendis sur ma couche de zostère, et je m’endormis profondément,
pendant que le Nautilus se glissait à travers le rapide courant du Fleuve
Noir.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le fleuve noir 130
Une invitation par lettre
Le lendemain, 9 novembre, je ne me réveillai qu’après un long sommeil de
douze heures. Conseil vint, suivant son habitude, savoir « comment
monsieur avait passé la nuit » et lui offrir ses services. Il avait laissé son
ami le Canadien dormant comme un homme qui n’aurait fait que cela toute
sa vie.
Je laissai le brave garçon babiller à sa fantaisie, sans trop lui répondre.
J’étais préoccupé de l’absence du capitaine Nemo pendant notre séance de
la veille, et j’espérais le revoir aujourd’hui.
Bientôt j’eus revêtu mes vêtements de byssus. Leur nature provoqua plus
d’une fois les réflexions de Conseil. Je lui appris qu’ils étaient fabriqués
avec les filaments lustrés et soyeux qui rattachent aux rochers les «
jambonneaux », sortes de coquilles très abondantes sur les rivages de la
Méditerranée. Autrefois, on en faisait de belles étoffes, des bas, des gants,
car ils étaient à la fois très moelleux et très chauds. L’équipage du Nautilus
pouvait donc se vêtir à bon compte, sans rien demander ni aux cotonniers,
ni aux moutons, ni aux vers à soie de la terre.
Lorsque je fus habillé, je me rendis au grand salon. Il était désert.
Je me plongeai dans l’étude de ces trésors de conchyliologie, entassés sous
les vitrines. Je fouillai aussi de vastes herbiers, emplis des plantes marines
les plus rares, et qui, quoique desséchées, conservaient leurs admirables
couleurs. Parmi ces précieuses hydrophytes, je remarquai des cladostèphes
verticillées, des padines−paon, des caulerpes à feuilles de vigne, des
callithamnes granifères, de délicates céramies à teintes écarlates, des
agares disposées en éventails, des acétabules, semblables à des chapeaux
de champignons très déprimés, et qui furent longtemps classées parmi les
zoophytes, enfin toute une série de varechs.
Une invitation par lettre 131
La journée entière se passa, sans que je fusse honoré de la visite du
capitaine Nemo. Les panneaux du salon ne s’ouvrirent pas. Peut−être ne
voulait−on pas nous blaser sur ces belles choses.
La direction du Nautilus se maintint à l’est−nord−est, sa vitesse à douze
milles, sa profondeur entre cinquante et soixante mètres.
Le lendemain, 10 novembre, même abandon, même solitude. Je ne vis
personne de l’équipage. Ned et Conseil passèrent la plus grande partie de
la journée avec moi. Ils s’étonnèrent de l’inexplicable absence du
capitaine. Cet homme singulier était−il malade ? Voulait−il modifier ses
projets à notre égard ?
Après tout, suivant la remarque de Conseil. nous jouissions d’une entière
liberté, nous étions délicatement et abondamment nourris. Notre hôte se
tenait dans les termes de son traité. Nous ne pouvions nous plaindre, et
d’ailleurs, la singularité même de notre destinée nous réservait de si belles
compensations, que nous n’avions pas encore le droit de l’accuser.
Ce jour−là, je commençai le journal de ces aventures, ce qui m’a permis de
les raconter avec la plus scrupuleuse exactitude, et, détail curieux, je
l’écrivis sur un papier fabriqué avec la zostère marine.
Le 11 novembre, de grand matin, l’air frais répandu à l’intérieur du
Nautilus m’apprit que nous étions revenus à la surface de l’Océan, afin de
renouveler les provisions d’oxygène. Je me dirigeai vers l’escalier central,
et je montai sur la plate−forme.
Il était six heures. Je trouvai le temps couvert, la mer grise, mais calme. A
peine de houle. Le capitaine Nemo, que j’espérais rencontrer là,
viendrait−il ? Je n’aperçus que le timonier, emprisonné dans sa cage de
verre. Assis sur la saillie produite par la coque du canot, j’aspirai avec
délices les émanations salines.
Peu à peu, la brume se dissipa sous l’action des rayons solaires. L’astre
radieux débordait de l’horizon oriental. La mer s’enflamma sous son
regard comme une traînée de poudre. Les nuages, éparpillés dans les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 132
hauteurs, se colorèrent de tons vifs admirablement nuancés, et de
nombreuses « langues de chat » annoncèrent du vent pour toute la journée.
Mais que faisait le vent à ce Nautilus que les tempêtes ne pouvaient
effrayer !
J’admirai donc ce joyeux lever de soleil, si gai, si vivifiant, lorsque
j’entendis quelqu’un monter vers la plate−forme.
Je me préparais à saluer le capitaine Nemo, mais ce fut son second – que
j’avais déjà vu pendant la première visite du capitaine – qui apparut. Il
s’avança sur la plate−forme et ne sembla pas s’apercevoir de ma présence.
Sa puissante lunette aux yeux, il scruta tous les points de l’horizon avec
une attention extrême. Puis, cet examen fait, il s’approcha du panneau, et
prononça une phrase dont voici exactement les termes. Je l’ai retenue, car,
chaque matin, elle se reproduisit dans des conditions identiques. Elle était
ainsi conçue :
« Nautron respoc lorni virch. »
Ce qu’elle signifiait, je ne saurais le dire.
Ces mots prononcés, le second redescendit. Je pensai que le Nautilus allait
reprendre sa navigation sous−marine. Je regagnai donc le panneau, et par
les coursives je revins à ma chambre.
Cinq jours s’écoulèrent ainsi, sans que la situation se modifiât. Chaque
matin, je montais sur la plate−forme. La même phrase était prononcée par
le même individu. Le capitaine Nemo ne paraissait pas.
J’avais pris mon parti de ne plus le voir, quand, le 16 novembre, rentré
dans ma chambre avec Ned et Conseil, je trouvai sur la table un billet à
mon adresse.
Je l’ouvris d’une main impatiente. Il était écrit d’une écriture franche et
nette, mais un peu gothique et qui rappelait les types allemands.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 133
Ce billet était libellé en ces termes :
Monsieur le professeur Aronnax, à bord du Nautilus.
16 novembre 1867.
Le capitaine Nemo invite monsieur le professeur Aronnax à une partie de
chasse qui aura lieu demain matin dans ses
forêts de l’île Crespo. Il espère que rien n’empêchera monsieur le
professeur d’y assister, et il verra avec plaisir que ses compagnons se
joignent à lui.
Le commandant du Nautilus,
Capitaine NEMO. »
« Une chasse ! s’écria Ned.
— Et dans ses forêts de l’île Crespo ! ajouta Conseil.
— Mais il va donc à terre, ce particulier−là ? reprit Ned Land.
— Cela me paraît clairement indiqué, dis−je en relisant la lettre.
— Eh bien ! il faut accepter, répliqua le Canadien. Une fois sur la terre
ferme, nous aviserons à prendre un parti. D’ailleurs, je ne serai pas fâché
de manger quelques morceaux de venaison fraîche. »
Sans chercher à concilier ce qu’il y avait de contradictoire entre l’horreur
manifeste du capitaine Nemo pour les continents et les îles, et son
invitation de chasser en forêt, je me contentai de répondre :
« Voyons d’abord ce que c’est que l’île Crespo. »
Je consultai le planisphère, et, par 32°40’de latitude nord et 167°50’de
longitude ouest, je trouvai un îlot qui fut reconnu en 1801 par le capitaine
Crespo, et que les anciennes cartes espagnoles nommaient Rocca de la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 134
Plata, c’est−à−dire « Roche d’Argent ». Nous étions donc à dix−huit cents
milles environ de notre point de départ, et la direction un peu modifiée du
Nautilus le ramenait vers le sud−est.
Je montrai à mes compagnons ce petit roc perdu au milieu du Pacifique
nord.
« Si le capitaine Nemo va quelquefois à terre, leur dis−je, il choisit du
moins des îles absolument désertes ! »
Ned Land hocha la tête sans répondre, puis Conseil et lui me quittèrent.
Après un souper qui me fut servi par le stewart muet et impassible, je
m’endormis, non sans quelque préoccupation.
Le lendemain, 17 novembre, à mon réveil, je sentis que le Nautilus était
absolument immobile. Je m’habillai lestement, et j’entrai dans le grand
salon.
Le capitaine Nemo était là. Il m’attendait, se leva, salua, et me demanda
s’il me convenait de l’accompagner.
Comme il ne fit aucune allusion à son absence pendant ces huit jours, je
m’abstins de lui en parler, et je répondis simplement que mes compagnons
et moi nous étions prêts à le suivre.
« Seulement, monsieur, ajoutai−je, je me permettrai de vous adresser une
question.
— Adressez, monsieur Aronnax, et, si je puis y répondre, j’y répondrai.
— Eh bien, capitaine, comment se fait−il que vous, qui avez rompu toute
relation avec la terre, vous possédiez des forêts dans l’île Crespo ?
— Monsieur le professeur, me répondit le capitaine, les forêts que je
possède ne demandent au soleil ni sa lumière ni sa chaleur. Ni les lions, ni
les tigres, ni les panthères, ni aucun quadrupède ne les fréquentent. Elles
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 135
ne sont connues que de moi seul. Elles ne poussent que pour moi seul. Ce
ne sont point des forêts terrestres, mais bien des forêts sous−marines.
— Des forêts sous−marines ! m’écriai−je.
— Oui, monsieur le professeur.
— Et vous m’offrez de m’y conduire ?
— Précisément.
— A pied ?
— Et même à pied sec.
— En chassant ?
— En chassant.
— Le fusil à la main ?
— Le fusil à la main. »
Je regardai le commandant du Nautilus d’un air qui n’avait rien de flatteur
pour sa personne.
« Décidément, il a le cerveau malade, pensai−je. Il a eu un accès qui a dure
huit jours, et même qui dure encore. C’est dommage ! Je l’aimais mieux
étrange que fou ! »
Cette pensée se lisait clairement sur mon visage, mais le capitaine Nemo se
contenta de m’inviter à le suivre, et je le suivis en homme résigné à tout.
Nous arrivâmes dans la salle à manger, où le déjeuner se trouvait servi.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 136
« Monsieur Aronnax, me dit le capitaine, je vous prierai de partager mon
déjeuner sans façon. Nous causerons en mangeant. Mais, si je vous ai
promis une promenade en
forêt, je ne me suis point engagé à vous y faire rencontrer un restaurant.
Déjeunez donc en homme qui ne dînera probablement que fort tard. »
Je fis honneur au repas. Il se composait de divers poissons et de tranches
d’holoturies, excellents zoophytes, relevés d’algues très apéritives, telles
que la Porphyria laciniata et la Laurentia primafetida. La boisson se
composait d’eau limpide à laquelle, à l’exemple du capitaine, j’ajoutai
quelques gouttes d’une liqueur fermentée, extraite, suivant la mode
kamchatkienne, de l’algue connue sous le nom de « Rhodoménie palmée ».
Le capitaine Nemo mangea, d’abord, sans prononcer une seule parole.
Puis, il me dit :
« Monsieur le professeur, quand je vous ai proposé de venir chasser dans
mes forêts de Crespo, vous m’avez cru en contradiction avec moi−même.
Quand je vous ai appris qu’il s’agissait de forêts sous−marines, vous
m’avez cru fou. Monsieur le professeur, il ne faut jamais juger les hommes
à la légère.
— Mais, capitaine, croyez que...
— Veuillez m’écouter, et vous verrez si vous devez m’accuser de folie ou
de contradiction.
— Je vous écoute.
— Monsieur le professeur, vous le savez aussi bien que moi, l’homme peut
vivre sous l’eau à la condition d’emporter avec lui sa provision d’air
respirable. Dans les travaux sous−marins, l’ouvrier, revêtu d’un vêtement
imperméable et la tête emprisonnée dans une capsule de métal, reçoit l’air
de l’extérieur au moyen de pompes foulantes et de régulateurs
d’écoulement.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 137
— C’est l’appareil des scaphandres, dis−je.
— En effet, mais dans ces conditions, l’homme n’est pas libre. Il est
rattache à la pompe qui lui envoie l’air par un tuyau de caoutchouc,
véritable chaîne qui le rive à la terre, et si nous devions être ainsi retenus
au Nautilus, nous ne pourrions aller loin.
— Et le moyen d’être libre ? demandai−je.
— C’est d’employer l’appareil Rouquayrol−Denayrouze, imaginé par deux
de vos compatriotes, mais que j’ai perfectionné pour mon usage, et qui
vous permettra de vous risquer dans ces nouvelles conditions
physiologiques, sans que vos organes en souffrent aucunement. Il se
compose d’un réservoir en tôle épaisse, dans lequel j’emmagasine l’air
sous une pression de cinquante atmosphères. Ce réservoir se fixe sur le dos
au moyen de bretelles, comme un sac de soldat. Sa partie supérieure forme
une boîte d’où l’air, maintenu par un mécanisme à soufflet, ne peut
s’échapper qu’à sa tension normale. Dans l’appareil Rouquayrol, tel qu’il
est employé, deux tuyaux en caoutchouc, partant de cette boîte, viennent
aboutir à une sorte de pavillon qui emprisonne le nez et la bouche de
l’opérateur ; l’un sert à l’introduction de l’air inspiré, l’autre à l’issue de
l’air expiré, et la langue ferme celui−ci ou celui−là, suivant les besoins de
la respiration. Mais, moi qui affronte des pressions considérables au fond
des mers, j’ai dû enfermer ma tête, comme celle des scaphandres, dans une
sphère de cuivre, et c’est à cette sphère qu’aboutissent les deux tuyaux
inspirateurs et expirateurs.
— Parfaitement, capitaine Nemo, mais l’air que vous emportez doit s’user
vite, et dès qu’il ne contient plus que quinze pour cent d’oxygène, il
devient irrespirable.
Sans doute, mais je vous l’ai dit, monsieur Aronnax, les pompes du
Nautilus me permettent de l’emmagasiner sous une pression considérable,
et, dans ces conditions, le réservoir de l’appareil peut fournir de l’air
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 138
respirable pendant neuf ou dix heures.
— Je n’ai plus d’objection à faire, répondis−je. Je vous demanderai
seulement, capitaine, comment vous pouvez éclairer votre route au fond de
l’Océan ?
— Avec l’appareil Ruhmkorff, monsieur Aronnax. Si le premier se porte
sur le dos, le second s’attache à la ceinture. Il se compose d’une pile de
Bunzen que je mets en activité, non avec du bichromate de potasse, mais
avec du sodium. Une bobine d’induction recueille l’électricité produite, et
la dirige vers une lanterne d’une disposition particulière. Dans cette
lanterne se trouve un serpentin de verre qui contient seulement un résidu
de gaz carbonique. Quand l’appareil fonctionne, ce gaz devient lumineux,
en donnant une lumière blanchâtre et continue. Ainsi pourvu, je respire et
je vois.
— Capitaine Nemo, à toutes mes objections vous faites de si écrasantes
réponses que je n’ose plus douter. Cependant, si je suis bien forcé
d’admettre les appareils Rouquayrol et Ruhmkorff, je demande à faire des
réserves pour le fusil dont vous voulez m’armer.
— Mais ce n’est point un fusil à poudre, répondit le capitaine.
— C’est donc un fusil à vent ?
— Sans doute. Comment voulez−vous que je fabrique de la poudre à mon
bord, n’ayant ni salpêtre, ni soufre ni charbon ?
— D’ailleurs, dis−je, pour tirer sous l’eau, dans un milieu huit cent
cinquante−cinq fois plus dense que l’air il faudrait vaincre une résistance
considérable.
— Ce ne serait pas une raison. Il existe certains canons, perfectionnés
après Fulton par les Anglais Philippe Coles et Burley, par le Français
Furcy, par l’Italien Landi, qui sont munis d’un système particulier de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 139
fermeture, et qui peuvent tirer dans ces conditions. Mais je vous le répète,
n’ayant pas de poudre, je l’ai remplacée par de l’air à haute pression, que
les pompes du Nautilus me fournissent abondamment.
— Mais cet air doit rapidement s’user.
— Eh bien, n’ai−je pas mon réservoir Rouquayrol, qui peut, au besoin,
m’en fournir. Il suffit pour cela d’un robinet ad hoc. D’ailleurs, monsieur
Aronnax, vous verrez par vous−même que, pendant ces chasses
sous−marines, on ne fait pas grande dépense d’air ni de balles.
— Cependant, il me semble que dans cette demi−obscurité, et au milieu de
ce liquide très dense par rapport à l’atmosphère, les coups ne peuvent
porter loin et sont difficilement mortels ?
— Monsieur, avec ce fusil tous les coups sont mortels, au contraire, et dès
qu’un animal est touché, si légèrement que ce soit, il tombe foudroyé.
— Pourquoi ?
— Parce que ce ne sont pas des balles ordinaires que ce fusil lance, mais
de petites capsules de verre – inventées par le chimiste autrichien
Leniebroek – et dont j’ai un approvisionnement considérable. Ces capsules
de verre, recouvertes d’une armature d’acier, et alourdies par un culot de
plomb, sont de véritables petites bouteilles de Leyde, dans lesquelles
l’électricité est forcée à une très haute tension. Au plus léger choc, elles se
déchargent, et l’animal, si puissant qu’il soit, tombe mort. J’ajouterai que
ces capsules ne sont pas plus grosses que du numéro quatre, et que la
charge d’un fusil ordinaire pourrait en contenir dix.
— Je ne discute plus, répondis−je en me levant de table, et je n’ai plus
qu’à prendre mon fusil. D’ailleurs, ou vous irez, j’irai.
Le capitaine Nemo me conduisit vers l’arrière du Nautilus, et, en passant
devant la cabine de Ned et de Conseil, j’appelai mes deux compagnons qui
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 140
nous suivirent aussitôt.
Puis, nous arrivâmes à une cellule située en abord près de la chambre des
machines, et dans laquelle nous devions revêtir nos vêtements de
promenade.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une invitation par lettre 141
Promenade en plaine
Cette cellule était, à proprement parler, l’arsenal et le vestiaire du Nautilus.
Une douzaine d’appareils de scaphandres, suspendus à la paroi, attendaient
les promeneurs.
Ned Land, en les voyant, manifesta une répugnance évidente à s’en revêtir.
« Mais, mon brave Ned, lui dis−je, les forêts de l’île de Crespo ne sont que
des forêts sous−marines !
— Bon ! fit le harponneur désappointé, qui voyait s’évanouir ses rêves de
viande fraîche. Et vous, monsieur Aronnax, vous allez vous introduire dans
ces habits−là ?
— Il le faut bien, maître Ned.
— Libre à vous, monsieur, répondit le harponneur, haussant les épaules,
mais quant à moi, à moins qu’on ne m’y force, je n’entrerai jamais
là−dedans.
— On ne vous forcera pas, maître Ned, dit le capitaine Nemo.
— Et Conseil va se risquer ? demanda Ned.
— Je suis monsieur partout où va monsieur », répondit Conseil.
Sur un appel du capitaine, deux hommes de l’équipage vinrent nous aider à
revêtir ces lourds vêtements imperméables, faits en caoutchouc sans
couture, et préparés de manière à supporter des pressions considérables.
On eût dit une armure à la fois souple et résistante. Ces vêtements
formaient pantalon et veste. Le pantalon se terminait par d’épaisses
chaussures, garnies de lourdes semelles de plomb. Le tissu de la veste était
Promenade en plaine 142
maintenu par des lamelles de cuivre qui cuirassaient la poitrine, la
défendaient contre la poussée des eaux, et laissaient les poumons
fonctionner librement ; ses manches finissaient en forme de gants
assouplis, qui ne contrariaient aucunement les mouvements de la main.
Il y avait loin, on le voit, de ces scaphandres perfectionnés aux vêtements
informes, tels que les cuirasses de liège, les soubrevestes, les habits de
mer, les coffres, etc. , qui furent inventés et prônés dans le XVIIIe siècle.
Le capitaine Nemo, un de ses compagnons – sorte d’Hercule, qui devait
être d’une force prodigieuse −, Conseil et moi, nous eûmes bientôt revêtu
ces habits de scaphandres. Il ne s’agissait plus que d’emboîter notre tête
dans sa sphère métallique. Mais, avant de procéder à cette opération, je
demandai au capitaine la permission d’examiner les fusils qui nous étaient
destinés.
L’un des hommes du Nautilus me présenta un fusil simple dont la crosse,
faite en tôle d’acier et creuse à l’intérieur, était d’assez grande dimension.
Elle servait de réservoir à l’air comprimé, qu’une soupape, manoeuvrée par
une gâchette, laissait échapper dans le tube de métal. Une boîte à
projectiles, évidée dans l’épaisseur de la crosse, renfermait une vingtaine
de balles électriques, qui, au moyen d’un ressort, se plaçaient
automatiquement dans le canon du fusil. Dès qu’un coup était tiré, l’autre
était prêt à partir.
« Capitaine Nemo, dis−je, cette arme est parfaite et d’un maniement facile.
Je ne demande plus qu’à l’essayer. Mais comment allons−nous gagner le
fond de la mer ?
— En ce moment, monsieur le professeur, le Nautilus est échoué par dix
mètres d’eau, et nous n’avons plus qu’à partir.
— Mais comment sortirons−nous ?
— Vous l’allez voir. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Promenade en plaine 143
Le capitaine Nemo introduisit sa tête dans la calotte sphérique. Conseil et
moi, nous en fîmes autant, non sans avoir entendu le Canadien nous lancer
un « bonne chasse » ironique. Le haut de notre vêtement était terminé par
un collet de cuivre taraudé, sur lequel se vissait ce casque de métal. Trois
trous, protégés par des verres épais, permettaient de voir suivant toutes les
directions, rien qu’en tournant la tête à l’intérieur de cette sphère. Dès
qu’elle fut en place, les appareils Rouquayrol, placés sur notre dos,
commencèrent à fonctionner, et, pour mon compte, je respirai à l’aise.
La lampe Ruhmkorff suspendue à ma ceinture, le fusil à la main, j’étais
prêt à partir. Mais, pour être franc, emprisonné dans ces lourds vêtements
et cloué au tillac par mes semelles de plomb, il m’eût été impossible de
faire un pas.
Mais ce cas était prévu, car je sentis que l’on me poussait dans une petite
chambre contiguë au vestiaire. Mes compagnons, également remorqués,
me suivaient. J’entendis une porte, munie d’obturateurs, se refermer sur
nous, et une profonde obscurité nous enveloppa.
Après quelques minutes, un vif sifflement parvint à mon oreille. Je sentis
une certaine impression de froid monter de mes pieds à ma poitrine.
Évidemment, de l’intérieur du bateau on avait, par un robinet, donné entrée
à l’eau extérieure qui nous envahissait, et dont cette chambre fut bientôt
remplie. Une seconde porte, percée dans le flanc du Nautilus, s’ouvrit
alors. Un demi−jour nous éclaira. Un instant après, nos pieds foulaient le
fond de la mer.
Et maintenant. comment pourrais−je retracer les impressions que m’a
laissées cette promenade sous les eaux ? Les mots sont impuissants à
raconter de telles merveilles ! Quand le pinceau lui−même est inhabile à
rendre les effets particuliers à l’élément liquide, comment la plume
saurait−elle les reproduire ?
Le capitaine Nemo marchait en avant, et son compagnon nous suivait à
quelques pas en arrière. Conseil et moi, nous restions l’un près de l’autre,
comme si un échange de paroles eût été possible à travers nos carapaces
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Promenade en plaine 144
métalliques. Je ne sentais déjà plus la lourdeur de mes vêtements, de mes
chaussures, de mon réservoir d’air, ni le poids de cette épaisse sphère, au
milieu de laquelle ma tête ballottait comme une amande dans sa coquille.
Tous ces objets, plongés dans l’eau, perdaient une partie de leur poids
égale à celui du liquide déplacé. et je me trouvais très bien de cette loi
physique reconnue par Archimède. Je n’étais plus une masse inerte, et
j’avais une liberté de mouvement relativement grande.
La lumière, qui éclairait le sol jusqu’à trente pieds au−dessous de la
surface de l’Océan, m’étonna par sa puissance. Les rayons solaires
traversaient aisément cette masse aqueuse et en dissipaient la coloration. Je
distinguais nettement les objets à une distance de cent mètres. Au−delà, les
fonds se nuançaient des fines dégradations de l’outremer, puis ils
bleuissaient dans les lointains, et s’effaçaient au milieu d’une vague
obscurité. Véritablement, cette eau qui m’entourait n’était qu’une sorte
d’air, plus dense que l’atmosphère terrestre, mais presque aussi diaphane.
Au−dessus de moi, j’apercevais la calme surface de la mer.
Nous marchions sur un sable fin, uni, non ridé comme celui des plages qui
conserve l’empreinte de la houle. Ce tapis éblouissant, véritable réflecteur,
repoussait les rayons du soleil avec une surprenante intensité. De là, cette
immense réverbération qui pénétrait toutes les molécules liquides. Serai−je
cru si j’affirme, qu’à cette profondeur de trente pieds, j’y voyais comme en
plein jour ?
Pendant un quart d’heure, je foulai ce sable ardent, semé d’une impalpable
poussière de coquillages. La coque du Nautilus, dessinée comme un long
écueil, disparaissait peu à peu, mais son fanal, lorsque la nuit se serait faite
au milieu des eaux, devait faciliter notre retour à bord, en projetant ses
rayons avec une netteté parfaite. Effet difficile à comprendre pour qui n’a
vu que sur terre ces nappes blanchâtres si vivement accusées. Là, la
poussière dont l’air est saturé leur donne l’apparence d’un brouillard
lumineux ; mais sur mer, comme sous mer, ces traits électriques se
transmettent avec une incomparable pureté.
Cependant, nous allions toujours, et la vaste plaine de sable semblait être
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Promenade en plaine 145
sans bornes. J’écartais de la main les rideaux liquides qui se refermaient
derrière moi, et la trace de mes pas s’effaçait soudain sous la pression de
l’eau.
Bientôt, quelques formes d’objets. à peine estompées dans l’éloignement,
se dessinèrent à mes yeux. Je reconnus de magnifiques premiers plans de
rochers, tapissés de zoophytes du plus bel échantillon, et je fus tout
d’abord frappé d’un effet spécial à ce milieu.
Il était alors dix heures du matin. Les rayons du soleil frappaient la surface
des flots sous un angle assez oblique, et au contact de leur lumière
décomposée par la réfraction comme à travers un prisme, fleurs, rochers,
plantules, coquillages, polypes, se nuançaient sur leurs bords des sept
couleurs du spectre solaire. C’était une merveille, une fête des yeux, que
cet enchevêtrement de tons colorés, une véritable kaléidoscopie de vert, de
jaune, d’orange, de violet, d’indigo, de bleu, en un mot, toute la palette
d’un coloriste enragé ! Que ne pouvais−je communiquer à Conseil les
vives sensations qui me montaient au cerveau, et rivaliser avec lui
d’interjections admiratives ! Que ne savais−je, comme le capitaine Nemo
et son compagnon, échanger mes pensées au moyen de signes convenus !
Aussi, faute de mieux, je me parlais à moi−même. je criais dans la boîte de
cuivre qui coiffait ma tête, dépensant peut−être en vaines paroles plus d’air
qu’il ne convenait.
Devant ce splendide spectacle, Conseil s’était arrête comme moi.
Évidemment, le digne garçon. en présence de ces échantillons de
zoophytes et de mollusques, classait, classait toujours. Polypes et
échinodermes abondaient sur le sol. Les isis variées, les cornulaires qui
vivent isolément, des touffes d’oculines vierges, désignées autrefois sous
le nom de « corail blanc », les fongies hérissées en forme de champignons,
les anémones adhérant par leur disque musculaire, figuraient un parterre de
fleurs, émaillé de porpites parées de leur collerette de tentacules azurés,
d’étoiles de mer qui constellaient le sable, et d’astérophytons verruqueux,
fines dentelles brodées par la main des naïades, dont les festons se
balançaient aux faibles ondulations provoquées par notre marche. C’était
un véritable chagrin pour moi d’écraser sous mes pas les brillants
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Promenade en plaine 146
spécimens de mollusques qui jonchaient le sol par milliers, les peignes
concentriques, les marteaux, les donaces, véritables coquilles bondissantes,
les troques, les casques rouges, les strombes aile−d’ange, les aphysies, et
tant d’autres produits de cet inépuisable Océan. Mais il fallait marcher, et
nous allions en avant, pendant que voguaient au−dessus de nos têtes des
troupes de physalies, laissant leurs tentacules d’outre−mer flotter à la
traîne, des méduses dont l’ombrelle opaline ou rose tendre, festonnée d’un
liston d’azur, nous abritait des rayons solaires, et des pélagies panopyres,
qui, dans l’obscurité, eussent semé notre chemin de lueurs
phosphorescentes !
Toutes ces merveilles, je les entrevis dans l’espace d’un quart de mille,
m’arrêtant à peine, et suivant le capitaine Nemo, qui me rappelait d’un
geste. Bientôt, la nature du sol se modifia. A la plaine de sable succéda une
couche de vase visqueuse que les Américains nomment « oaze »,
uniquement composée de coquilies siliceuses ou calcaires. Puis, nous
parcourûmes une prairie d’algues, plantes pélagiennes que les eaux
n’avaient pas encore arrachées, et dont la végétation était fougueuse. Ces
pelouses à tissu serré, douces au pied, eussent rivalisé avec les plus
moelleux tapis tissés par la main des hommes. Mais, en même temps que
la verdure s’étalait sous nos pas, elle n’abandonnait pas nos têtes. Un léger
berceau de plantes marines, classées dans cette exubérante famille des
algues, dont on connaît plus de deux mille espèces, se croisait à la surface
des eaux. Je voyais flotter de longs rubans de fucus, les uns globuleux, les
autres tubulés, des laurencies, des cladostèphes, au feuillage si délié, des
rhodymènes palmés, semblables à des éventails de cactus. J’observai que
les plantes vertes se maintenaient plus près de la surface de la mer, tandis
que les rouges occupaient une profondeur moyenne, laissant aux
hydrophytes noires ou brunes le soin de former les jardins et les parterres
des couches reculées de l’Océan.
Ces algues sont véritablement un prodige de la création, une des merveilles
de la flore universelle. Cette famille produit à la fois les plus petits et les
plus grands végétaux du globe. Car de même qu’on a compté quarante
mille de ces imperceptibles plantules dans un espace de cinq millimètres
carrés, de même on a recueilli des fucus dont la longueur dépassait cinq
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Promenade en plaine 147
cents mètres.
Nous avions quitté le Nautilus depuis une heure et demie environ. Il était
près de midi. Je m’en aperçus à la perpendicularité des rayons solaires qui
ne se réfractaient plus. La magie des couleurs disparut peu à peu, et les
nuances de l’émeraude et du saphir s’effacèrent de notre firmament. Nous
marchions d’un pas régulier qui résonnait sur le sol avec une intensité
étonnante. Les moindres bruits se transmettaient avec une vitesse à
laquelle l’oreille n’est pas habituée sur la terre. En effet, l’eau est pour le
son un meilleur véhicule que l’air, et il s’y propage avec une rapidité
quadruple.
En ce moment, le sol s’abaissa par une pente prononcée. La lumière prit
une teinte uniforme. Nous atteignîmes une profondeur de cent mètres,
subissant alors une pression de dix atmosphères. Mais mon vêtement de
scaphandre était établi dans des conditions telles que je ne souffrais
aucunement de cette pression. Je sentais seulement une certaine gêne aux
articulations des doigts, et encore ce malaise ne tarda−t−il pas à
disparaître. Quant à la fatigue que devait amener cette promenade de deux
heures sous un harnachement dont j’avais si peu l’habitude, elle était nulle.
Mes mouvements, aidés par l’eau, se produisaient avec une surprenante
facilité.
Arrivé à cette profondeur de trois cents pieds, je percevais encore les
rayons du soleil, mais faiblement. A leur éclat intense avait succédé un
crépuscule rougeâtre. moyen terme entre le jour et la nuit. Cependant, nous
voyions suffisamment à nous conduire. et il n’était pas encore nécessaire
de mettre les appareils Ruhmkorff en activité.
En ce moment, le capitaine Nemo s’arrêta. Il attendit que je l’eusse rejoint,
et du doigt, il me montra quelques masses obscures qui s’accusaient dans
l’ombre à une petite distance.
« C’est la forêt de l’île Crespo », pensai−je, et je ne me trompais pas.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Promenade en plaine 148
Une forêt sous marine
Nous étions enfin arrivés à la lisière de cette forêt, sans doute l’une des
plus belles de l’immense domaine du capitaine Nemo. Il la considérait
comme étant sienne, et s’attribuait sur elle les mêmes droits qu’avaient les
premiers hommes aux premiers jours du monde. D’ailleurs, qui lui eût
disputé la possession de cette propriété sous−marine ? Quel autre pionnier
plus hardi serait venu, la hache à la main, en défricher les sombres taillis ?
Cette forêt se composait de grandes plantes arborescentes, et, dès que nous
eûmes pénétré sous ses vastes arceaux. mes regards furent tout d’abord
frappés d’une singulière disposition de leurs ramures – disposition que je
n’avais pas encore observée jusqu’alors.
Aucune des herbes qui tapissaient le sol, aucune des branches qui
hérissaient les arbrisseaux, ne rampait, ni ne se courbait, ni ne s’étendait
dans un plan horizontal. Toutes montaient vers la surface de l’Océan. Pas
de filaments, pas de rubans, si minces qu’ils fussent, qui ne se tinssent
droit comme des tiges de fer. Les fucus et les lianes se développaient
suivant une ligne rigide et perpendiculaire, commandée par la densité de
l’élément qui les avait produits. Immobiles, d’ailleurs, lorsque je les
écartais de la main, ces plantes reprenaient aussitôt leur position première.
C’était ici le règne de la verticalité.
Bientôt, je m’habituai à cette disposition bizarre, ainsi qu’à l’obscurité
relative qui nous enveloppait. Le sol de la forêt était semé de blocs aigus,
difficiles à éviter. La flore sous−marine m’y parut être assez complète,
plus riche même qu’elle ne l’eût été sous les zones arctiques ou tropicales,
où ses produits sont moins nombreux. Mais, pendant quelques minutes, je
confondis involontairement les règnes entre eux, prenant des zoophytes
pour des hydrophytes, des animaux pour des plantes. Et qui ne s’y fût pas
trompé ? La faune et la flore se touchent de si près dans ce monde
sous−marin !
Une forêt sous marine 149
J’observai que toutes ces productions du règne végétal ne tenaient au sol
que par un empâtement superficiel. Dépourvues de racines, indifférentes au
corps solide, sable, coquillage, test ou galet, qui les supporte, elles ne lui
demandent qu’un point d’appui, non la vitalité. Ces plantes ne procèdent
que d’elles−mêmes, et le principe de leur existence est dans cette eau qui
les soutient, qui les nourrit. La plupart, au lieu de feuilles, poussaient des
lamelles de formes capricieuses, circonscrites dans une gamme restreinte
de couleurs, qui ne comprenait que le rose, le carmin, le vert, l’olivâtre, le
fauve et le brun. Je revis là, mais non plus desséchées comme les
échantillons du Nautilus, des padines−paons, déployées en éventails qui
semblaient solliciter la brise, des céramies écarlates, des laminaires
allongeant leurs jeunes pousses comestibles, des néréocystées filiformes et
fluxueuses, qui s’épanouissaient à une hauteur de quinze mètres, des
bouquets s’acétabules, « Curieuse anomalie, bizarre élément, a dit un
spirituel naturaliste, où le règne animal fleurit, et où le règne végétal ne
fleurit pas ! »
Entre ces divers arbrisseaux, grands comme les arbres des zones
tempérées, et sous leur ombre humide, se massaient de véritables buissons
à fleurs vivantes, des haies de zoophytes, sur lesquels s’épanouissaient des
méandrines zébrées de sillons tortueux, des cariophylles jaunâtres à
tentacules diaphanes, des touffes gazonnantes de zoanthaires, et pour
compléter l’illusion, les poissons−mouches volaient de branches en
branches, comme un essaim de colibris, tandis que de jaunes lépisacanthes,
à la mâchoire hérissée, aux écailles aiguës, des dactyloptères et des
monocentres, se levaient sous nos pas, semblables à une troupe de
bécassines.
Vers une heure, le capitaine Nemo donna le signal de la halte. J’en fus
assez satisfait pour mon compte, et nous nous étendîmes sous un berceau
d’alariées, dont les longues lanières amincies se dressaient comme des
flèches.
Cet instant de repos me parut délicieux. Il ne nous manquait que le charme
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une forêt sous marine 150
de la conversation. Mais impossible de parler, impossible de répondre.
J’approchai seulement ma grosse tête de cuivre de la tête de Conseil. Je vis
les yeux de ce brave garçon briller de contentement, et en signe de
satisfaction. il s’agita dans sa carapace de l’air le plus comique du monde.
Après quatre heures de cette promenade, je fus très étonné de ne pas
ressentir un violent besoin de manger. A quoi tenait cette disposition de
l’estomac, je ne saurais le dire. Mais, en revanche, j’éprouvais une
insurmontable envie de dormir, ainsi qu’il arrive à tous les plongeurs.
Aussi mes yeux se fermèrent−ils bientôt derrière leur épaisse vitre, et je
tombai dans une invincible somnolence, que le mouvement de la marche
avait seul pu combattre jusqu’alors. Le capitaine Nemo et son robuste
compagnon, étendus dans ce limpide cristal, nous donnaient l’exemple du
sommeil.
Combien de temps restai−je ainsi plongé dans cet assoupissement, je ne
pus l’évaluer ; mais lorsque je me réveillai, il me sembla que le soleil
s’abaissait vers l’horizon. Le capitaine Nemo s’était déjà relevé, et je
commençais à me détirer les membres, quand une apparition inattendue me
remit brusquement sur les pieds.
A quelques pas, une monstrueuse araignée de mer, haute d’un mètre, me
regardait de ses yeux louches, prête à s’élancer sur moi. Quoique mon
habit de scaphandre fût assez épais pour me défendre contre les morsures
de cet animal, je ne pus retenir un mouvement d’horreur. Conseil et le
matelot du Nautilus s’éveillèrent en ce moment. Le capitaine Nemo montra
à son compagnon le hideux crustacé, qu’un coup de crosse abattit aussitôt,
et je vis les horribles pattes du monstre se tordre dans des convulsions
terribles.
Cette rencontre me fit penser que d’autres animaux, plus redoutables,
devaient hanter ces fonds obscurs, et que mon scaphandre ne me
protégerait pas contre leurs attaques. Je n’y avais pas songé jusqu’alors, et
je résolus de me tenir sur mes gardes. Je supposais, d’ailleurs, que cette
halte marquait le terme de notre promenade ; mais je me trompais, et, au
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une forêt sous marine 151
lieu de retourner au Nautilus, le capitaine Nemo continua son audacieuse
excursion.
Le sol se déprimait toujours, et sa pente, s’accusant davantage, nous
conduisit à de plus grandes profondeurs. Il devait être à peu près trois
heures, quand nous atteignîmes une étroite vallée, creusée entre de hautes
parois à pic, et située par cent cinquante mètres de fond. Grâce à la
perfection de nos appareils, nous dépassions ainsi de quatre−vingt−dix
mètres la limite que la nature semblait avoir imposée jusqu’ici aux
excursions sous−marines de l’homme.
Je dis cent cinquante mètres, bien qu’aucun instrument ne me permît
d’évaluer cette distance. Mais je savais que, même dans les mers les plus
limpides, les rayons solaires ne pouvaient pénétrer plus avant. Or,
précisément, l’obscurité devint profonde. Aucun objet n’était visible à dix
pas. Je marchais donc en tâtonnant, quand je vis briller subitement une
lumière blanche assez vive. Le capitaine Nemo venait de mettre son
appareil électrique en activité. Son compagnon l’imita. Conseil et moi nous
suivîmes leur exemple. J’établis, en tournant une vis, la communication
entre la bobine et le serpentin de verre, et la mer, éclairée par nos quatre
lanternes, s’illumina dans un rayon de vingt−cinq mètres.
Le capitaine Nemo continua de s’enfoncer dans les obscures profondeurs
de la forêt dont les arbrisseaux se raréfiaient de plus en plus. J’observai
que la vie végétale disparaissait plus vite que la vie animale. Les plantes
pélagiennes abandonnaient déjà le sol devenu aride, qu’un nombre
prodigieux d’animaux, zoophytes, articulés, mollusques et poissons y
pullulaient encore.
Tout en marchant, je pensais que la lumière de nos appareils Ruhmkorff
devait nécessairement attirer quelques habitants de ces sombres couches.
Mais s’ils nous approchèrent, ils se tinrent du moins à une distance
regrettable pour des chasseurs. Plusieurs fois, je vis le capitaine Nemo
s’arrêter et mettre son fusil en joue ; puis, après quelques instants
d’observation, il se relevait et reprenait sa marche.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une forêt sous marine 152
Enfin, vers quatre heures environ, cette merveilleuse excursion s’acheva.
Un mur de rochers superbes et d’une masse imposante se dressa devant
nous, entassement de blocs gigantesques, énorme falaise de granit, creusée
de grottes obscures, mais qui ne présentait aucune rampe praticable.
C’étaient les accores de l’île Crespo. C’était la terre.
Le capitaine Nemo s’arrêta soudain. Un geste de lui nous fit faire halte, et
si désireux que je fusse de franchir cette muraille, je dus m’arrêter. Ici
finissaient les domaines du capitaine Nemo. Il ne voulait pas les dépasser.
Au−delà, c’était cette portion du globe qu’il ne devait plus fouler du pied.
Le retour commença. Le capitaine Nemo avait repris la tête de sa petite
troupe, se dirigeant toujours sans hésiter. Je crus voir que nous ne suivions
pas le même chemin pour revenir au Nautilus. Cette nouvelle route, très
raide, et par conséquent très pénible, nous rapprocha rapidement de la
surface de la mer. Cependant, ce retour dans les couches supérieures ne fut
pas tellement subit que la décompression se fit trop rapidement, ce qui
aurait pu amener dans notre organisme des désordres graves, et déterminer
ces lésions internes si fatales aux plongeurs. Très promptement, la lumière
reparut et grandit, et, le soleil étant déjà bas sur l’horizon, la réfraction
borda de nouveau les divers objets d’un anneau spectral.
A dix mètres de profondeur, nous marchions au milieu d’un essaim de
petits poissons de toute espèce, plus nombreux que les oiseaux dans l’air,
plus agiles aussi, mais aucun gibier
aquatique, digne d’un coup de fusil. ne s’était encore offert à nos regards.
En ce moment, je vis l’arme du capitaine, vivement épaulée, suivre entre
les buissons un objet mobile. Le coup partit, j’entendis un faible
sifflement, et un animal retomba foudroyé à quelques pas.
C’était une magnifique loutre de mer, une enhydre, le seul quadrupède qui
soit exclusivement marin. Cette loutre, longue d’un mètre cinquante
centimètres, devait avoir un très grand prix. Sa peau, d’un brun marron en
dessus, et argentée en dessous, faisait une de ces admirables fourrures si
recherchées sur les marchés russes et chinois ; la finesse et le lustre de son
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une forêt sous marine 153
poil lui assuraient une valeur minimum de deux mille francs. J’admirai fort
ce curieux mammifère à la tête arrondie et ornée d’oreilles courtes, aux
yeux ronds, aux moustaches blanches et semblables à celles du chat, aux
pieds palmés et unguiculés, à la queue touffue. Ce précieux carnassier,
chassé et traqué par les pêcheurs, devient extrêmement rare, et il s’est
principalement réfugié dans les portions boréales du Pacifique, où
vraisemblablement son espèce ne tardera pas à s’éteindre.
Le compagnon du capitaine Nemo vint prendre la bête, la chargea sur son
épaule, et l’on se remit en route.
Pendant une heure, une plaine de sable se déroula devant nos pas. Elle
remontait souvent à moins de deux mètres de la surface des eaux. Je voyais
alors notre image, nettement reflétée, se dessiner en sens inverse, et,
au−dessus de nous, apparaissait une troupe identique. reproduisant nos
mouvements et nos gestes, de tout point semblable, en un mot, à cela près
qu’elle marchait la tête en bas et les pieds en l’air.
Autre effet à noter. C’était le passage de nuages épais qui se formaient et
s’évanouissaient rapidement ; mais en réfléchissant, je compris que ces
prétendus nuages n’étaient dus qu’à l’épaisseur variable des longues lames
de fond, et j’apercevais même les « moutons » écumeux que leur crête
brisée multipliait sur les eaux. Il n’était pas jusqu’à l’ombre des grands
oiseaux qui passaient sur nos têtes, dont je ne surprisse le rapide
effleurement à la surface de la mer.
En cette occasion, je fus témoin de l’un des plus beaux coups de fusil qui
ait jamais fait tressaillir les fibres d’un chasseur. Un grand oiseau, à large
envergure, très nettement visible, s’approchait en planant. Le compagnon
du capitaine Nemo le mit en joue et le tira, lorsqu’il fut à quelques mètres
seulement au−dessus des flots. L’animal tomba foudroyé, et sa chute
l’entraîna jusqu’à la portée de l’adroit chasseur qui s’en empara. C’était un
albatros de la plus belle espèce, admirable spécimen des oiseaux pélagiens.
Notre marche n’avait pas été interrompue par cet incident. Pendant deux
heures, nous suivîmes tantôt des plaines sableuses, tantôt des prairies de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une forêt sous marine 154
varechs, fort pénibles à traverser. Franchement, je n’en pouvais plus,
quand j’aperçus une vague lueur qui rompait, à un demi mille, l’obscurité
des eaux. C’était le fanal du Nautilus. Avant vingt minutes, nous devions
être à bord, et là, je respirerais à l’aise, car il me semblait que mon
réservoir ne fournissait plus qu’un air très pauvre en oxygène. Mais je
comptais sans une rencontre qui retarda quelque peu notre arrivée.
J’étais resté d’une vingtaine de pas en arrière, lorsque je vis le capitaine
Nemo revenir brusquement vers moi. De sa main vigoureuse, il me courba
à terre, tandis que son compagnon en faisait autant de Conseil. Tout
d’abord, je ne sus trop que penser de cette brusque attaque, mais je me
rassurai en observant que le capitaine se couchait près de moi et demeurait
immobile.
J’étais donc étendu sur le sol, et précisément à l’abri d’un buisson de
varechs, quand, relevant la tête, j’aperçus d’énormes masses passer
bruyamment en jetant des lueurs phosphorescentes.
Mon sang se glaça dans mes veines ! J’avais reconnu les formidables
squales qui nous menaçaient. C’était un couple de tintoréas, requins
terribles, à la queue énorme, au regard terne et vitreux, qui distillent une
matière phosphorescente par des trous percés autour de leur museau.
Monstrueuses mouches à feu, qui broient un homme tout entier dans leurs
mâchoires defer ! Je ne sais si Conseil s’occupait à les classer, mais pour
mon compte, j’observais leur ventre argenté, leur gueule formidable,
hérissée de dents, à un point de vue peu scientifique, et plutôt en victime
qu’en naturaliste.
Très heureusement, ces voraces animaux y voient mal. Ils passèrent sans
nous apercevoir, nous effleurant de leurs nageoires brunâtres, et nous
échappâmes, comme par miracle, à ce danger plus grand, à coup sûr, que la
rencontre d’un tigre en pleine forêt.
Une demi−heure après, guidés par la traînée électrique, nous atteignions le
Nautilus. La porte extérieure était restée ouverte, et le capitaine Nemo la
referma, dès que nous fûmes rentrés dans la première cellule. Puis, il
pressa un bouton. J’entendis manoeuvrer les pompes au dedans du navire,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une forêt sous marine 155
je sentis l’eau baisser autour de moi et, en quelques instants, la cellule fut
entièrement vidée. La porte intérieure s’ouvrit alors, et nous passâmes dans
le vestiaire.
Là, nos habits de scaphandre furent retirés, non sans peine, et, très harassé,
tombant d’inanition et de sommeil, je regagnai ma chambre, tout
émerveillé de cette surprenante excursion au fond des mers.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une forêt sous marine 156
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique
Le lendemain matin, 18 novembre, j’étais parfaitement remis de mes
fatigues de la veille, et je montai sur la plate−forme, au moment ou le
second du Nautilus prononçait sa phrase quotidienne. Il me vint alors à
l’esprit qu’elle se rapportait à l’état de la mer, ou plutôt qu’elle signifiait :
« Nous n’avons rien en vue. »
Et en effet, l’Océan était désert. Pas une voile à l’horizon. Les hauteurs de
l’île Crespo avaient disparu pendant la nuit. La mer, absorbant les couleurs
du prisme, à l’exception des rayons bleus, réfléchissait ceux−ci dans toutes
les directions et revêtait une admirable teinte d’indigo. Une moire, à larges
raies, se dessinait régulièrement sur les flots onduleux.
J’admirais ce magnifique aspect de l’Océan, quand le capitaine Nemo
apparut. Il ne sembla pas s’apercevoir de ma présence, et commença une
série d’observations astronomiques. Puis, son opération terminée, il alla
s’accouder sur la cage du fanal, et ses regards se perdirent à la surface de
l’Océan.
Cependant, une vingtaine de matelots du Nautilus, tous gens vigoureux et
bien constitues, étaient montés sur la plate−forme. Ils venaient retirer les
filets qui avaient été mis à la traîne pendant la nuit. Ces marins
appartenaient évidemment à des nations différentes, bien que le type
européen fût indiqué chez tous. Je reconnus, à ne pas me tromper, des
Irlandais, des Français, quelques Slaves, un Grec ou un Candiote. Du reste,
ces hommes étaient sobres de paroles, et n’employaient entre eux que ce
bizarre idiome dont je ne pouvais pas même soupçonner l’origine. Aussi,
je dus renoncer à les interroger.
Les filets furent halés à bord. C’étaient des espèces de chaluts, semblables
à ceux des côtes normandes, vastes poches qu’une vergue flottante et une
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 157
chaîne transfilée dans les mailles inférieures tiennent entr’ouvertes. Ces
poches, ainsi traînées sur leurs gantiers de fer, balayaient le fond de
l’Océan et ramassaient tous ses produits sur leur passage. Ce jour−là, ils
ramenèrent de curieux échantillons de ces parages poissonneux, des
lophies, auxquels leurs mouvements comiques ont valu le qualificatif
d’histrions, des commerçons noirs, munis de leurs antennes, des balistes
ondulés, entourés de bandelettes rouges, des tétrodons−croissants, dont le
venin est extrêmement subtil, quelques lamproies olivâtres, des
macrorhinques, couverts d’écailles argentées, des trichiures, dont la
puissance électrique est égale à celle du gymnote et de la torpille, des
notoptères écailleux, à bandes brunes et transversales, des gades verdâtres,
plusieurs variétés de gobies, etc. , enfin, quelques poissons de proportions
plus vastes, un caranx à tête proéminente, long d’un mètre, plusieurs beaux
scombres bonites, chamarrés de couleurs bleues et argentées, et trois
magnifiques thons que la rapidité de leur marche n’avait pu sauver du
chalut.
J’estimai que ce coup de filet rapportait plus de mille livres de poissons.
C’était une belle pêche, mais non surprenante. En effet, ces filets restent à
la traîne pendant plusieurs heures et enserrent dans leur prison de fil tout
un monde aquatique. Nous ne devions donc pas manquer de vivres d’une
excellente qualité, que la rapidité du Nautilus et l’attraction de sa lumière
électrique pouvaient renouveler sans cesse.
Ces divers produits de la mer furent immédiatement affalés par le panneau
vers les cambuses, destinés, les uns à être mangés frais, les autres à être
conservés.
La pêche finie, la provision d’air renouvelée, je pensais que le Nautilus
allait reprendre son excursion sous−marine, et je me préparais à regagner
ma chambre, quand, se tournant vers moi, le capitaine Nemo me dit sans
autre préambule :
« Voyez cet océan, monsieur le professeur, n’est−il pas doué d’une vie
réelle ? N’a−t−il pas ses colères et ses tendresses ? Hier, il s’est endormi
comme nous, et le voilà qui se réveille après une nuit paisible ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 158
Ni bonjour, ni bonsoir ! N’eût−on pas dit que cet étrange personnage
continuait avec moi une conversation déjà commencée ?
« Regardez, reprit−il, il s’éveille sous les caresses du soleil ! Il va revivre
de son existence diurne ! C’est une intéressante étude que de suivre le jeu
de son organisme. Il possède un pouls, des artères, il a ses spasmes, et je
donne raison à ce savant Maury, qui a découvert en lui une circulation
aussi réelle que la circulation sanguine chez les animaux. »
Il est certain que le capitaine Nemo n’attendait de moi aucune réponse, et il
me parut inutile de lui prodiguer les « Evidemment », les « A coup sûr », et
les « Vous avez raison ». Il se parlait plutôt à lui−même, prenant de longs
temps entre chaque phrase. C’était une méditation à voix haute.
« Oui, dit−il, l’Océan possède une circulation véritable, et, pour la
provoquer, il a suffi au Créateur de toutes choses de multiplier en lui le
calorique, le sel et les animalcules. Le calorique, en effet, crée des densités
différentes, qui amènent les courants et les contre−courants. L’évaporation,
nulle aux régions hyperboréennes, très active dans les zones équatoriales,
constitue un échange permanent des eaux tropicales et des eaux polaires.
En outre, j’ai surpris ces courants de haut en bas et de bas en haut, qui
forment la vraie respiration de l’Océan. J’ai vu la molécule d’eau de mer,
échauffée à la surface, redescendre vers les profondeurs, atteindre son
maximum de densité à deux degrés au−dessous de zéro, puis se
refroidissant encore, devenir plus légère et remonter. Vous verrez, aux
pôles, les conséquences de ce phénomène, et vous comprendrez pourquoi,
par cette loi de la prévoyante nature, la congélation ne peut jamais se
produire qu’à la surface des eaux ! »
Pendant que le capitaine Nemo achevait sa phrase, je me disais : « Le
pôle ! Est−ce que cet audacieux personnage prétend nous conduire
jusque−là ! »
Cependant, le capitaine s’était tu, et regardait cet élément si complètement,
si incessamment étudié par lui. Puis reprenant :
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 159
« Les sels, dit−il, sont en quantité considérable dans la mer, monsieur le
professeur, et si vous enleviez tous ceux qu’elle contient en dissolution,
vous en feriez une masse de quatre millions et demi de lieues cubes, qui,
étalée sur le globe, formerait une couche de plus de dix mètres de hauteur.
Et ne croyez pas que la présence de ces sels ne soit due qu’à un caprice de
la nature. Non. Ils rendent les eaux marines moins évaporables, et
empêchent les vents de leur enlever une trop grande quantité de vapeurs,
qui, en se résolvant, submergeraient les zones tempérées.
Rôle immense, rôle de pondérateur dans l’économie générale du globe ! »
Le capitaine Nemo s’arrêta, se leva même, fit quelques pas sur la
plate−forme, et revint vers moi :
« Quant aux infusoires, reprit−il, quant à ces milliards d’animalcules, qui
existent par millions dans une gouttelette, et dont il faut huit cent mille
pour peser un milligramme, leur rôle n’est pas moins important. Ils
absorbent les sels marins, ils s’assimilent les éléments solides de l’eau, et,
véritables faiseurs de continents calcaires, ils fabriquent des coraux et des
madrépores ! Et alors la goutte d’eau, privée de son aliment minéral,
s’allège, remonte à la surface, y absorbe les sels abandonnés par
l’évaporation, s’alourdit, redescend, et rapporte aux animalcules de
nouveaux éléments à absorber. De là, un double courant ascendant et
descendant, et toujours le mouvement, toujours la vie ! La vie, plus intense
que sur les continents, plus exubérante, plus infinie, s’épanouissant dans
toutes les parties de cet océan, élément de mort pour l’homme, a−t−on dit,
élément de vie pour des myriades d’animaux et pour moi ! »
Quand le capitaine Nemo parlait ainsi, il se transfigurait et provoquait en
moi une extraordinaire émotion.
« Aussi, ajouta−t−il, là est la vraie existence ! Et je concevrais la fondation
de villes nautiques, d’agglomérations de maisons sous−marines, qui,
comme le Nautilus reviendraient respirer chaque matin à la surface des
mers, villes libres, s’il en fut, cités indépendantes ! Et encore, qui sait si
quelque despote... »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 160
Le capitaine Nemo acheva sa phrase par un geste violent. Puis, s’adressant
directement à moi, comme pour chasser une pensée funeste :
« Monsieur Aronnax, me demanda−t−il, savez−vous quelle est la
profondeur de l’Océan ?
— Je sais, du moins, capitaine, ce que les principaux sondages nous ont
appris.
— Pourriez−vous me les citer, afin que je les contrôle au besoin ?
— En voici quelques−uns, répondis−je, qui me reviennent à la mémoire. Si
je ne me trompe, on a trouvé une profondeur moyenne de huit mille deux
cents mètres dans l’Atlantique nord, et de deux mille cinq cents mètres
dans la Méditerranée. Les plus remarquables sondes ont été faites dans
l’Atlantique sud, près du trente−cinquième degré, et elles ont donné douze
mille mètres, quatorze mille quatre−vingt−onze mètres, et quinze mille
cent quarante−neuf mètres. En somme, on estime que si le fond de la mer
était nivelé, sa profondeur moyenne serait de sept kilomètres environ.
— Bien, monsieur le professeur, répondit le capitaine Nemo, nous vous
montrerons mieux que cela, je l’espère. Quant à la profondeur moyenne de
cette partie du Pacifique, je vous apprendrai qu’elle est seulement de
quatre mille mètres. »
Ceci dit, le capitaine Nemo se dirigea vers le panneau et disparut par
l’échelle. Je le suivis, et je regagnai le grand salon. L’hélice se mit aussitôt
en mouvement, et le loch accusa une vitesse de vingt milles à l’heure.
Pendant les jours, pendant les semaines qui s’écoulèrent, le capitaine
Nemo fut très sobre de visites. Je ne le vis qu’à de rares intervalles. Son
second faisait régulièrement le point que je trouvais reporté sur la carte, de
telle sorte que je pouvais relever exactement la route du Nautilus.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 161
Conseil et Land passaient de longues heures avec moi. Conseil avait
raconté à son ami les merveilles de notre promenade, et le Canadien
regrettait de ne nous avoir point accompagnés. Mais j’espérais que
l’occasion se représenterait de visiter les forêts océaniennes.
Presque chaque jour, pendant quelques heures, les panneaux du salon
s’ouvraient, et nos yeux ne se fatiguaient pas de pénétrer les mystères du
monde sous−marin.
La direction générale du Nautilus était sud−est, et il se maintenait entre
cent mètres et cent cinquante mètres de profondeur. Un jour, cependant,
par je ne sais quel caprice, entraîné diagonalement au moyen de ses plans
inclinés, il atteignit les couches d’eau situées par deux mille mètres. Le
thermomètre indiquait une température de 4,25 centigrades, température
qui, sous cette profondeur, paraît être commune à toutes les latitudes.
Le 26 novembre, à trois heures du matin le Nautilus franchit le tropique du
Cancer par 172° de longitude. Le 27, il passa en vue des Sandwich, où
l’illustre Cook trouva la mort, le 14 février 1779. Nous avions alors fait
quatre mille huit cent soixante lieues depuis notre point de départ. Le
matin, lorsque j’arrivai sur la plate−forme, j’aperçus, à deux milles sous le
vent, Haouaï, la plus considérable des sept îles qui forment cet archipel. Je
distinguai nettement sa lisière cultivée, les diverses chaînes de montagnes
qui courent parallèlement à la côte, et ses volcans que domine le
Mouna−Rea, élevé de cinq mille mètres au−dessus du niveau de la mer.
Entre autres échantillons de ces parages, les filets rapportèrent des
flabellaires pavonées, polypes comprimés de forme gracieuse, et qui sont
particuliers à cette partie de l’Océan.
La direction du Nautilus se maintint au sud−est. Il coupa l’Équateur, le 1er
décembre, par 142° de longitude, et le 4 du même mois, après une rapide
traversée que ne signala aucun incident, nous eûmes connaissance du
groupe des Marquises. J’aperçus à trois milles, par 8°57’de latitude sud et
139°32’de longitude ouest, la pointe Martin de Nouka−Hiva, la principale
de ce groupe qui appartient à la France. Je vis seulement les montagnes
boisées qui se dessinaient à l’horizon, car le capitaine Nemo n’aimait pas à
rallier les terres. Là, les filets rapportèrent de beaux spécimens de poissons,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 162
des choryphènes aux nageoires azurées et à la queue d’or, dont la chair est
sans rivale au monde, des hologymnoses à peu près dépourvus d’écailles,
mais d’un goût exquis, des ostorhinques à mâchoire osseuse, des thasards
jaunâtres qui valaient la bonite, tous poissons dignes d’être classés à
l’office du bord.
Après avoir quitté ces îles charmantes protégées par le pavillon français,
du 4 au 11 décembre, le Nautilus parcourut environ deux mille milles.
Cette navigation fut marquée par la rencontre d’une immense troupe de
calmars, curieux mollusques, très voisins de la seiche. Les pêcheurs
français les désignent sous le nom d’encornets, et ils appartiennent à la
classe des céphalopodes et à la famille des dibranchiaux, qui comprend
avec eux les seiches et les argonautes. Ces animaux furent particulièrement
étudiés par les naturalistes de l’antiquité, et ils fournissaient de nombreuses
métaphores aux orateurs de l’Agora, en même temps qu’un plat excellent à
la table des riches citoyens, s’il faut en croire Athénée, médecin grec, qui
vivait avant Gallien.
Ce fut pendant la nuit du 9 au 10 décembre, que le Nautilus rencontra cette
armée de mollusques qui sont particulièrement nocturnes. On pouvait les
compter par millions. Ils émigraient des zones tempérées vers les zones
plus chaudes, en suivant l’itinéraire des harengs et des sardines. Nous les
regardions à travers les épaisses vitres de cristal, nageant à reculons avec
une extrême rapidité, se mouvant au moyen de leur tube locomoteur,
poursuivant les poissons et les mollusques, mangeant les petits, mangés
des gros, et agitant dans une confusion indescriptible les dix pieds que la
nature leur a implantés sur la tête, comme une chevelure de serpents
pneumatiques. Le Nautilus, malgré sa vitesse, navigua pendant plusieurs
heures au milieu de cette troupe d’animaux. et ses filets en ramenèrent une
innombrable quantité, où je reconnus les neuf espèces que d’Orbigny a
classées pour l’océan Pacifique.
On le voit, pendant cette traversée, la mer prodiguait incessamment ses
plus merveilleux spectacles. Elle les variait à l’infini. Elle changeait son
décor et sa mise en scène pour le plaisir de nos yeux, et nous étions appelés
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 163
non seulement à contempler les oeuvres du Créateur au milieu de l’élément
liquide, mais encore à pénétrer les plus redoutables mystères de l’Océan.
Pendant la journée du 11 décembre, j’étais occupé à lire dans le grand
salon. Ned Land et Conseil observaient les eaux lumineuses par les
panneaux entr’ouverts. Le Nautilus était immobile. Ses réservoirs remplis,
il se tenait à une profondeur de mille mètres, région peut habitée des
Océans, dans laquelle les gros poissons faisaient seuls de rares apparitions.
Je lisais en ce moment un livre charmant de Jean Macé, les
Serviteurs de l’estomac, et j’en savourais les leçons ingénieuses, lorsque
Conseil interrompit ma lecture.
« Monsieur veut−il venir un instant ? me dit−il d’une voix singulière.
— Qu’y a−t−il donc, Conseil ?
— Que monsieur regarde. »
Je me levai, j’allai m’accouder devant la vitre, et je regardai.
En pleine lumière électrique, une énorme masse noirâtre, immobile, se
tenait suspendue au milieu des eaux. Je l’observai attentivement, cherchant
à reconnaître la nature de ce gigantesque cétacé. Mais une pensée traversa
subitement mon esprit.
« Un navire ! m’écriai−je.
— Oui, répondit le Canadien, un bâtiment désemparé qui a coule a pic ! »
Ned Land ne se trompait pas. Nous étions en présence d’un navire, dont les
haubans coupés pendaient encore a leurs cadènes. Sa coque paraissait être
en bon état, et son naufrage datait au plus de quelques heures. Trois
tronçons de mâts, rasés à deux pieds au−dessus du pont, indiquaient que ce
navire engagé avait dû sacrifier sa mâture. Mais, couché sur le flanc, il
s’était rempli, et il donnait encore la bande à bâbord. Triste spectacle que
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 164
celui de cette carcasse perdue sous les flots, mais plus triste encore la vue
de son pont où quelques cadavres, amarrés par des cordes, gisaient encore !
J’en comptai quatre – quatre hommes, dont l’un se tenait debout, au
gouvernail – puis une femme, à demi−sortie par la claire−voie de la
dunette, et tenant un enfant dans ses bras. Cette femme était jeune. Je pus
reconnaître, vivement éclairés par les feux du Nautilus, ses traits que l’eau
n’avait pas encore décomposés. Dans un suprême effort, elle avait élevé
au−dessus de sa tête son enfant, pauvre petit être dont les bras enlaçaient le
cou de sa mère ! L’attitude des quatre marins me parut effrayante, tordus
qu’ils étaient dans des mouvements convulsifs, et faisant un dernier effort
pour s’arracher des cordes qui les liaient au navire. Seul, plus calme, la
face nette et grave, ses cheveux grisonnants collés à son front, la main
crispée à la roue du gouvernail, le timonier semblait encore conduire son
trois−mâts naufragé à travers les profondeurs de l’Océan !
Quelle scène ! Nous étions muets, le coeur palpitant, devant ce naufrage
pris sur le fait, et, pour ainsi dire, photographié à sa dernière minute ! Et je
voyais déjà s’avancer, l’oeil en feu, d’énormes squales, attirés par cet appât
de chair humaine !
Cependant le Nautilus, évoluant, tourna autour du navire submergé, et, un
instant, je pus lire sur son tableau d’arrière :
Florida, Sunderland.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quatre mille lieues sous le Pacifique 165
Vanikoro
Ce terrible spectacle inaugurait la série des catastrophes maritimes, que le
Nautilus devait renconter sur sa route. Depuis qu’il suivait des mers plus
fréquentées, nous apercevions souvent des coques naufragées qui
achevaient de pourrir entre deux eaux, et, plus profondément, des canons,
des boulets, des ancres, des chaînes, et mille autres objets de fer, que la
rouille dévorait.
Cependant, toujours entraînés par ce Nautilus, où nous vivions comme
isolés, le 11 décembre, nous eûmes connaissance de l’archipel des
Pomotou, ancien « groupe dangereux » de Bougainville, qui s’étend sur un
espace de cinq cents lieues de l’est−sud−est à l’ouest−nord−ouest. entre
13°30’et 23°50’de latitude sud, et 125°30’et 151°30’de longitude ouest,
depuis l’île Ducie jusqu’à l’île Lazareff. Cet archipel couvre une superficie
de trois cent soixante−dix lieues carrées, et il est formé d’une soixantaine
de groupes d’îles, parmi lesquels on remarque le groupe Gambier, auquel
la France a imposé son protectorat. Ces îles sont coralligènes. Un
soulèvement lent, mais continu, provoqué par le travail des polypes, les
reliera un jour entre elles. Puis, cette nouvelle île se soudera plus tard aux
archipels voisins, et un cinquième continent s’étendra depuis la
Nouvelle−Zélande et la Nouvelle−Calédonie jusqu’aux Marquises.
Le jour où je développai cette théorie devant le capitaine Nemo, il me
répondit froidement :
« Ce ne sont pas de nouveaux continents qu’il faut à la terre, mais de
nouveaux hommes ! »
Les hasards de sa navigation avaient précisément conduit le Nautilus vers
l’île Clermont−Tonnerre, l’une des plus curieuses du groupe, qui fut
découvert en 1822, par le capitaine Bell, de la Minerve. Je pus alors étudier
ce système madréporique auquel sont dues les îles de cet Océan.
Vanikoro 166
Les madrépores, qu’il faut se garder de confondre avec les coraux, ont un
tissu revêtu d’un encroûtement calcaire, et les modifications de sa structure
ont amené M. Milne−Edwards, mon illustre maître, à les classer en cinq
sections. Les petits animalcules qui sécrètent ce polypier vivent par
milliards au fond de leurs cellules. Ce sont leurs dépôts calcaires qui
deviennent rochers, récifs, îlots, îles. Ici, ils forment un anneau circulaire,
entourant un lagon ou un petit lac intérieur, que des brèches mettent en
communication avec la mer. Là, ils figurent des barrières de récifs
semblables à celles qui existent sur les côtes de la Nouvelle−Calédonie et
de diverses îles des Pomotou. En d’autres endroits, comme à la Réunion et
à Maurice, ils élèvent des récifs frangés, hautes murailles droites, près
desquelles les profondeurs de l’Océan sont considérables.
En prolongeant à quelques encablures seulement les accores de l’île
Clermont−Tonnerre, j’admirai l’ouvrage gigantesque, accompli par ces
travailleurs microscopiques. Ces murailles étaient spécialement l’oeuvre
des madréporaires désignés par les noms de millepores, de porites,
d’astrées et de méandrines. Ces polypes se développent particulièrement
dans les couches agitées de la surface de la mer, et par conséquent, c’est
par leur partie supérieure qu’ils commencent ces substructions, lesquelles
s’enfoncent peu à peu avec les débris de sécrétions qui les supportent.
Telle est, du moins, la théorie de M. Darwin, qui explique ainsi la
formation des atolls – théorie supérieure, selon moi, à celle qui donne pour
base aux travaux madréporiques des sommets de montagnes ou de volcans,
immergés à quelques pieds au−dessous du niveau de la mer.
Je pus observer de très près ces curieuses murailles, car, à leur aplomb, la
sonde accusait plus de trois cents mètres de profondeur, et nos nappes
électriques faisaient étinceler ce brillant calcaire.
Répondant à une question que me posa Conseil, sur la durée
d’accroissement de ces barrières colossales, je l’étonnai beaucoup en lui
disant que les savants portaient cet accroissement à un huitième de pouce
par siècle.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 167
« Donc, pour élever ces murailles, me dit−il, il a fallu ? ...
— Cent quatre−vingt−douze mille ans, mon brave Conseil, ce qui allonge
singulièrement les jours bibliques. D’ailleurs, la formation de la houille,
c’est−à−dire la minéralisation des forêts enlisées par les déluges, a exigé
un temps beaucoup plus considérable. Mais j’ajouterai que les jours de la
Bible ne sont que des époques et non l’intervalle qui s’écoule entre deux
levers de soleil, car, d’après la Bible elle−même. Le soleil ne date pas du
premier jour de la création. »
Lorsque le Nautilus revint à la surface de l’Océan, je pus embrasser dans
tout son développement cette île de Clermont−Tonnerre, basse et boisée.
Ses roches madréporiques furent évidemment fertilisées par les trombes et
les tempêtes. Un jour, quelque graine, enlevée par l’ouragan aux terres
voisines, tomba sur les couches calcaires, mêlées des détritus décomposés
de poissons et de plantes marines qui formèrent l’humus végétal. Une noix
de coco, poussée par les lames, arriva sur cette côte nouvelle. Le germe
prit racine. L’arbre, grandissant, arrêta la vapeur d’eau. Le ruisseau naquit.
La végétation gagna peu à peu. Quelques animalcules, des vers, des
insectes, abordèrent sur des troncs arrachés aux îles du vent. Les tortues
vinrent pondre leurs oeufs. Les oiseaux nichèrent dans les jeunes arbres.
De cette façon, la vie animale se développa, et, attiré par la verdure et la
fertilité, l’homme apparut. Ainsi se formèrent ces îles, oeuvres immenses
d’animaux microscopiques.
Vers le soir, Clermont−Tonnerre se fondit dans l’éloignement, et la route
du Nautilus se modifia d’une manière sensible. Après avoir touché le
tropique du Capricorne par le cent trente−cinquième degré de longitude, il
se dirigea vers l’ouest−nord−ouest, remontant toute la zone intertropicale.
Quoique le soleil de l’été fût prodigue de ses rayons, nous ne souffrions
aucunement de la chaleur, car à trente ou quarante mètres au−dessous de
l’eau, la température ne s’élevait pas au−dessus de dix à douze degrés.
Le 15 décembre, nous laissions dans l’est le séduisant archipel de la
Société. et la gracieuse Taiti, la reine du Pacifique. J’aperçus le matin,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 168
quelques milles sous le vent, les sommets élevés de cette île. Ses eaux
fournirent aux tables du bord d’excellents poissons, des maquereaux, des
bonites, des albicores, et des variétés d’un serpent de mer nommé
munérophis.
Le Nautilus avait franchi huit mille cent milles. Neuf mille sept cent vingt
milles étaient relevés au loch, lorsqu’il passa entre l’archipel de
Tonga−Tabou, où périrent les équipages de l’Argo, du Port−au−Prince et
du Duke−of−Portland, et l’archipel des Navigateurs, où fut tué le capitaine
de Langle, l’ami de La Pérouse. Puis, il eut connaissance de l’archipel Viti,
où les sauvages massacrèrent les matelots de l’Union et le capitaine
Bureau, de Nantes, commandant l’Aimable−Josephine.
Cet archipel qui se prolonge sur une étendue de cent lieues du nord au sud,
et sur quatre−vingt−dix lieues de l’est à l’ouest, est compris entre 60 et 20
de latitude sud, et 174° et 179° de longitude ouest. Il se compose d’un
certain nombre d’îles, d’îlots et d’écueils, parmi lesquels on remarque les
îles de Viti−Levou, de Vanoua−Levou et de Kandubon.
Ce fut Tasman qui découvrit ce groupe en 1643, l’année même où Toricelli
inventait le baromètre, et où Louis XIV montait sur le trône. Je laisse à
penser lequel de ces faits fut le plus utile à l’humanité. Vinrent ensuite
Cook en 1714, d’Entrecasteaux en 1793, et enfin Dumont−d’Urville, en
1827, débrouilla tout le chaos géographique de cet archipel. Le Nautilus
s’approcha de la baie de Wailea, théâtre des terribles aventures de ce
capitaine Dillon, qui, le premier, éclaira le mystère du naufrage de La
Pérouse.
Cette baie, draguée à plusieurs reprises, fournit abondamment des huîtres
excellentes. Nous en mangeâmes immodérément, après les avoir ouvertes
sur notre table même, suivant le précepte de Sénèque. Ces mollusques
appartenaient à l’espèce connue sous le nom d’ostrea lamellosa, qui est
très commune en Corse. Ce banc de Wailea devait être considérable, et
certainement, sans des causes multiples de destruction, ces agglomérations
finiraient par combler les baies, puisque l’on compte jusqu’à deux millions
d’oeufs dans un seul individu.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 169
Et si maître Ned Land n’eut pas à se repentir de sa gloutonnerie en cette
circonstance, c’est que l’huître est le seul mets qui ne provoque jamais
d’indigestion. En effet, il ne faut pas moins de seize douzaines de ces
mollusques acéphales pour fournir les trois cent quinze grammes de
substance azotée, nécessaires à la nourriture quotidienne d’un seul homme.
Le 25 décembre, le Nautilus naviguait au milieu de l’archipel des
Nouvelles−Hébrides, que Quiros découvrit en 1606, que Bougainville
explora en 1768, et auquel Cook donna son nom actuel en 1773. Ce groupe
se compose principalement de neuf grandes îles, et forme une bande de
cent vingt lieues du nord−nord−ouest au sud−sud−est, comprise entre 15°
et 2° de latitude sud, et entre 164° et 168° de longitude. Nous passâmes
assez près de l’île d’Aurou, qui, au moment des observations de midi,
m’apparut comme une masse de bois verts, dominée par un pic d’une
grande hauteur.
Ce jour−là, c’était Noël, et Ned Land me sembla regretter vivement la
célébration du « Christmas », la véritable fête de la famille, dont les
protestants sont fanatiques.
Je n’avais pas aperçu le capitaine Nemo depuis une huitaine de jours,
quand le 27, au matin, il entra dans le grand salon, ayant toujours l’air d’un
homme qui vous a quitté depuis cinq minutes. J’étais occupé à reconnaître
sur le planisphère la route du Nautilus. Le capitaine s’approcha, posa un
doigt sur un point de la carte, et prononça ce seul mot :
« Vanikoro. »
Ce nom fut magique. C’était le nom des îlots sur lesquels vinrent se perdre
les vaisseaux de La Pérouse. Je me relevai subitement.
« Le Nautilus nous porte à Vanikoro ? demandai−je.
— Oui, monsieur le professeur, répondit le capitaine.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 170
— Et je pourrai visiter ces îles célèbres où se brisèrent la Boussole et
l’Astrolabe ?
— Si cela vous plaît, monsieur le professeur.
— Quand serons−nous à Vanikoro ?
— Nous y sommes, monsieur le professeur. »
Suivi du capitaine Nemo, je montait sur la plate−forme, et de là, mes
regards parcoururent avidement l’horizon.
Dans le nord−est émergeaient deux îles volcaniques d’inégale grandeur,
entourées d’un récif de coraux qui mesurait quarante milles de circuit.
Nous étions en présence de l’île de Vanikoro proprement dite, à laquelle
Dumont d’Urville imposa le nom d’île de la Recherche, et précisément
devant le petit havre de Vanou, situé par 16°4’de latitude sud, et 164°32’de
longitude est. Les terres semblaient recouvertes de verdure depuis la plage
jusqu’aux sommets de l’intérieur, que dominait le mont Kapogo, haut de
quatre cent soixante−seize toises.
Le Nautilus, après avoir franchi la ceinture extérieure de roches par une
étroite passe, se trouva en dedans des brisants, où la mer avait une
profondeur de trente à quarante brasses. Sous le verdoyant ombrage des
palétuviers, j’aperçus quelques sauvages qui montrèrent une extrême
surprise à notre approche. Dans ce long corps noirâtre, s’avançant à fleur
d’eau, ne voyaient−ils pas quelque cétacé formidable dont ils devaient se
défier ?
En ce moment, le capitaine Nemo me demanda ce que je
savais du naufrage de La Pérouse.
« Ce que tout le monde en sait, capitaine, lui répondis−je.
— Et pourriez−vous m’apprendre ce que tout le monde en sait ? me
demanda−t−il d’un ton un peu ironique.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 171
— Très facilement. »
Je lui racontai ce que les derniers travaux de Dumont d’Urville avaient fait
connaître, travaux dont voici le résumé très succinct.
La Pérouse et son second, le capitaine de Langle, furent envoyés par Louis
XVI, en 1785, pour accomplir un voyage de circumnavigation. Ils
montaient les corvettes la Boussole et l’Astrolabe, qui ne reparurent plus.
En 1791, le gouvernement français, justement inquiet du sort des deux
corvettes. arma deux grandes flûtes, la Recherche et l’Espérance, qui
quittèrent Brest, le 28 septembre, sous les ordres de Bruni d’Entrecasteaux.
Deux mois après, on apprenait par la déposition d’un certain Bowen,
commandant l’Albermale, que des débris de navires naufragés avaient été
vus sur les côtes de la Nouvelle−Géorgie. Mais d’Entrecasteaux, ignorant
cette communication, – assez incertaine, d’ailleurs – se dirigea vers les îles
de l’Amirauté, désignées dans un rapport du capitaine Hunter comme étant
le lieu du naufrage de La Pérouse.
Ses recherches furent vaines. L’Espérance et la Recherche passèrent même
devant Vanikoro sans s’y arrêter, et, en somme, ce voyage fut très
malheureux, car il coûta la vie à d’Entrecasteaux, à deux de ses seconds et
à plusieurs marins de son équipage.
Ce fut un vieux routier du Pacifique, le capitaine Dillon, qui, le premier,
retrouva des traces indiscutables des naufragés. Le 15 mai 1824, son
navire, le Saint−Patrick, passa près de l’île de Tikopia, l’une des
Nouvelles−Hébrides. Là, un lascar, l’ayant accosté dans une pirogue, lui
vendit une poignée d’épée en argent qui portait l’empreinte de caractères
gravés au burin. Ce lascar prétendait, en outre, que, six ans auparavant,
pendant un séjour à Vanikoro, il avait vu deux Européens qui appartenaient
à des navires échoués depuis de longues années sur les récifs de l’île.
Dillon devina qu’il s’agissait des navires de La Pérouse, dont la disparition
avait ému le monde entier. Il voulut gagner Vanikoro, où, suivant le lascar,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 172
se trouvaient de nombreux débris du naufrage ; mais les vents et les
courants l’en empêchèrent.
Dillon revint à Calcutta. Là, il sut intéresser à sa découverte la Société
Asiatique et la Compagnie des Indes. Un navire, auquel on donna le nom
de la Recherche, fut mis à sa disposition, et il partit, le 23 janvier 1827,
accompagné d’un agent français.
La Recherche, après avoir relâché sur plusieurs points du Pacifique,
mouilla devant Vanikoro, le 7 juillet 1827, dans ce même havre de Vanou,
où le Nautilus flottait en ce moment.
Là, il recueillit de nombreux restes du naufrage, des ustensiles de fer, des
ancres, des estropes de poulies, des pierriers, un boulet de dix−huit, des
débris d’instruments d’astronomie, un morceau de couronnement, et une
cloche en bronze portant cette inscription : « Bazin m’a fait », marque de
la fonderie de l’Arsenal de Brest vers 1785. Le doute n’était donc plus
possible.
Dillon, complétant ses renseignements, resta sur le lieu du sinistre jusqu’au
mois d’octobre. Puis, il quitta Vanikoro, se dirigea vers la
Nouvelle−Zélande, mouilla à Calcutta, le 7 avril 1828, et revint en France,
où il fut très sympathiquement accueilli par Charles X.
Mais, à ce moment, Dumont d’Urville, sans avoir eu connaissance des
travaux de Dillon, était déjà parti pour chercher ailleurs le théâtre du
naufrage. Et, en effet, on avait appris par les rapports d’un baleinier que
des médailles et une croix de Saint−Louis se trouvaient entre les mains des
sauvages de la Louisiade et de la Nouvelle−Calédonie.
Dumont d’Urville, commandant l’Astrolabe, avait donc pris la mer, et,
deux mois après que Dillon venait de quitter Vanikoro, il mouillait devant
Hobart−Town. Là, il avait connaissance des résultats obtenus par Dillon,
et, de plus, il apprenait qu’un certain James Hobbs, second de l’Union, de
Calcutta, ayant pris terre sur une île située par 8°18’de latitude sud et
156°30’de longitude est, avait remarqué des barres de fer et des étoffes
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 173
rouges dont se servaient les naturels de ces parages.
Dumont d’Urville, assez perplexe, et ne sachant s’il devait ajouter foi à ces
récits rapportés par des journaux peu dignes de confiance, se décida
cependant à se lancer sur les traces de Dillon.
Le 10 février 1828, I’Astrolabe se présenta devant Tikopia, prit pour guide
et interprète un déserteur fixé sur cette île, fit route vers Vanikoro, en eut
connaissance le 12 février, prolongea ses récifs jusqu’au 14, et, le 20
seulement, mouilla au−dedans de la barrière, dans le havre de Vanou.
Le 23, plusieurs des officiers firent le tour de l’île, et rapportèrent quelques
débris peu importants. Les naturels, adoptant un système de dénégations et
de faux−fuyants, refusaient de les mener sur le lieu du sinistre. Cette
conduite, très louche, laissa croire qu’ils avaient maltraité les naufragés, et,
en effet, ils semblaient craindre que Dumont d’Urville ne fût venu venger
La Pérouse et ses infortunés compagnons.
Cependant, le 26, décidés par des présents, et comprenant qu’ils n’avaient
à craindre aucune représaille, ils conduisirent le second, M. Jacquinot, sur
le théâtre du naufrage.
dans laquelle n’entra aucune ferrure qui pût tenter la cupidité des naturels.
Puis, Dumont d’Urville voulut partir ; mais ses équipages étaient minés par
les fièvres de ces côtes malsaines, et, très malade lui−même, il ne put
appareiller que le 17 mars.
Cependant, le gouvernement français, craignant que Dumont d’Urville ne
fût pas au courant des travaux de Dillon, avait envoyé à Vanikoro la
corvette la Bayonnaise, commandée par Legoarant de Tromelin, qui était
en station sur la côte ouest de l’Amérique. La Bayonnaise mouilla devant
Vanikoro, quelques mois après le départ de l’Astrolabe, ne trouva aucun
document nouveau, mais constata que les sauvages avaient respecté le
mausolée de La Pérouse.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 174
Telle est la substance du récit que je fis au capitaine Nemo.
« Ainsi, me dit−il, on ne sait encore où est allé périr ce troisième navire
construit par les naufragés sur l’île de Vanikoro ?
— On ne sait. »
Le capitaine Nemo ne répondit rien, et me fit signe de le suivre au grand
salon. Le Nautilus s’enfonça de quelques mètres au−dessous des flots, et
les panneaux s’ouvrirent.
Je me précipitai vers la vitre, et sous les empâtements de coraux, revêtus
de fongies, de syphonules, d’alcyons, de cariophyllées, à travers des
myriades de poissons charmants, des girelles, des glyphisidons, des
pomphérides, des diacopes, des holocentres, je reconnus certains débris
que les dragues n’avaient pu arracher, des étriers de fer, des ancres, des
canons, des boulets, une garniture de cabestan, une étrave, tous objets
provenant des navires naufragés et maintenant tapissés de fleurs vivantes.
Et pendant que je regardais ces épaves désolées, le capitaine Nemo me dit
d’une voix grave :
« Le commandant La Pérouse partit le 7 décembre 1785 avec ses navires la
Boussole et l’Astrolabe. Il mouilla d’abord à Botany−Bay, visita l’archipel
des Amis, la Nouvelle−Calédonie, se dirigea vers Santa−Cruz et relâcha à
Namouka, l’une des îles du groupe Hapaï. Puis, ses navires arrivèrent sur
les récifs inconnus de Vanikoro. La Boussole, qui marchait en avant,
s’engagea sur la côte méridionale. L’Astrolabe vint à son secours et
s’échoua de même. Le premier navire se détruisit presque immédiatement.
Le second, engravé sous le vent, résista quelques jours. Les naturels firent
assez bon accueil aux naufragés. Ceux−ci s’installèrent dans l’île, et
construisirent un bâtiment plus petit avec les débris des deux grands.
Quelques matelots restèrent volontairement à Vanikoro.
Les autres, affaiblis, malades, partirent avec La Pérouse. Ils se dirigèrent
vers les îles Salomon, et ils périrent, corps et biens, sur la côte occidentale
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 175
de l’île principale du groupe, entre les caps Déception et Satisfaction !
— Et comment le savez−vous ? m’écriai−je.
— Voici ce que j’ai trouvé sur le lieu même de ce dernier naufrage ! »
Le capitaine Nemo me montra une boîte de fer blanc, estampillée aux
armes de France, et toute corrodée par les eaux salines. Il l’ouvrit, et je vis
une liasse de papiers jaunis, mais encore lisibles.
C’étaient les instructions même du ministre de la Marine au commandant
La Pérouse, annotées en marge de la main de Louis XVI !
« Ah ! c’est une belle mort pour un marin ! dit alors le capitaine Nemo.
C’est une tranquille tombe que cette tombe de corail, et fasse le ciel que,
mes compagnons et moi, nous n’en ayons jamais d’autre ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Vanikoro 176
Le détroit de Torrès
Pendant la nuit du 27 au 28 décembre, le Nautilus abandonna les parages
de Vanikoro avec une vitesse excessive. Sa direction était sud−ouest, et, en
trois jours, il franchit les sept cent cinquante lieues qui séparent le groupe
de La Pérouse de la pointe sud−est de la Papouasie.
Le ler janvier 1863, de grand matin, Conseil me rejoignit sur la
plate−forme.
« Monsieur, me dit ce brave garçon, monsieur me permettra−t−il de lui
souhaiter une bonne année ?
— Comment donc, Conseil, mais exactement comme si j’étais à Paris,
dans mon cabinet du Jardin des Plantes. J’accepte tes voeux et je t’en
remercie. Seulement, je te demanderai ce que tu entends par « une bonne
année », dans les circonstances où nous nous trouvons. Est−ce l’année qui
amènera la fin de notre emprisonnement, ou l’année qui verra se continuer
cet étrange voyage ?
— Ma foi, répondit Conseil, je ne sais trop que dire à monsieur. Il est
certain que nous voyons de curieuses choses, et que, depuis deux mois,
nous n’avons pas eu le temps de nous ennuyer. La dernière merveille est
toujours la plus étonnante, et si cette progression se maintient, je ne sais
pas comment cela finira. M’est avis que nous ne retrouverons jamais une
occasion semblable.
— Jamais, Conseil.
— En outre, monsieur Nemo, qui justifie bien son nom latin, n’est pas plus
gênant que s’il n’existait pas.
Le détroit de Torrès 177
— Comme tu le dis, Conseil.
— Je pense donc, n’en déplaise à monsieur, qu’une bonne année serait une
année qui nous permettrait de tout voir...
— De tout voir, Conseil ? Ce serait peut−être long. Mais qu’en pense Ned
Land ?
— Ned Land pense exactement le contraire de moi, répondit Conseil. C’est
un esprit positif et un estomac impérieux. Regarder les poissons et toujours
en manger ne lui suffit pas. Le manque de vin, de pain, de viande, cela ne
convient guère à un digne Saxon auquel les beefsteaks sont familiers, et
que le brandy ou le gin, pris dans une proportion modérée, n’effrayent
guère !
— Pour mon compte, Conseil, ce n’est point là ce qui me tourmente, et je
m’accommode très bien du régime du bord.
— Moi de même, répondit Conseil. Aussi je pense autant à rester que
maître Land à prendre la fuite. Donc, si l’année qui commence n’est pas
bonne pour moi, elle le sera pour lui, et réciproquement. De cette façon, il
y aura toujours quelqu’un de satisfait. Enfin, pour conclure, je souhaite à
monsieur ce qui fera plaisir à monsieur.
— Merci, Conseil. Seulement je te demanderai de remettre à plus tard la
question des étrennes, et de les remplacer provisoirement par une bonne
poignée de main. Je n’ai que cela sur moi.
— Monsieur n’a jamais été si généreux », répondit Conseil.
Et là−dessus, le brave garçon s’en alla.
Le 2 janvier, nous avions fait onze mille trois cent quarante milles, soit
cinq mille deux cent cinquante lieues, depuis notre point de départ dans les
mers du Japon. Devant l’éperon du Nautilus s’étendaient les dangereux
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 178
parages de la mer de corail, sur la côte nord−est de l’Australie. Notre
bateau prolongeait à une distance de quelques milles ce redoutable banc
sur lequel les navires de Cook faillirent se perdre, le 10 juin 1770. Le
bâtiment que montait Cook donna sur un roc, et s’il ne coula pas, ce fut
grâce à cette circonstance que le morceau de corail, détaché au choc, resta
engagé dans la coque entr’ouverte.
J’aurais vivement souhaité de visiter ce récif long de trois cent soixante
lieues, contre lequel la mer, toujours houleuse, se brisait avec une intensité
formidable et comparable aux roulements du tonnerre. Mais en ce moment,
les plans inclinés du Nautilus nous entraînaient à une grande profondeur, et
je ne pus rien voir de ces hautes murailles coralligènes. Je dus me
contenter des divers échantillons de poissons rapportés par nos filets. Je
remarquai, entre autres, des germons, espèces de scombres grands comme
des thons. aux flancs bleuâtres et rayés de bandes transversales qui
disparaissent avec la vie de l’animal. Ces poissons nous accompagnaient
par troupes et fournirent à notre table une chair excessivement délicate. On
prit aussi un grand nombre de spares vertors, longs d’un demi−décimètre,
ayant le goût de la dorade, et des pyrapèdes volants, véritables hirondelles
sous−marines, qui, par les nuits obscures, rayent alternativement les airs et
les eaux de leurs lueurs phosphorescentes. Parmi les mollusques et les
zoophytes, je trouvai dans les mailles du chalut diverses espèces
d’alcyoniaires, des oursins, des marteaux, des éperons, des cadrans, des
cérites, des hyalles. La flore était représentée par de belles algues
flottantes, des laminaires et des macrocystes, imprégnées du mucilage qui
transsudait à travers leurs pores, et parmi lesquelles je recueillis une
admirable Nemastoma Geliniaroide, qui fut classée parmi les curiosités
naturelles du musée.
Deux jours après avoir traversé la mer de Corail, le 4 janvier, nous eûmes
connaissance des côtes de la Papouasie. A cette occasion, le capitaine
Nemo m’apprit que son intention était de gagner l’océan Indien par le
détroit de Torrès. Sa communication se borna là. Ned vit avec plaisir que
cette route le rapprochait des mers européennes.
Ce détroit de Torrès est regardé comme non moins dangereux par les
écueils qui le hérissent que par les sauvages habitants qui fréquentent ses
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 179
côtes. Il sépare de la Nouvelle−Hollande la grande île de la Papouasie,
nommée aussi Nouvelle−Guinée.
La Papouasie a quatre cents lieues de long sur cent trente lieues de large, et
une superficie de quarante mille lieues géographiques. Elle est située, en
latitude, entre 0°l9’et 10°2’sud, et en longitude, entre 128°23’et 146°15’.
A midi, pendant que le second prenait la hauteur du soleil, j’aperçus les
sommets des monts Arfalxs, élevés par plans et terminés par des pitons
aigus.
Cette terre, découverte en 1511 par le Portugais Francisco Serrano, fut
visitée successivement par don José de Menesès en 1526, par Grijalva en
1527, par le général espagnol Alvar de Saavedra en 1528, par Juigo Ortez
en 1545, par le Hollandais Shouten en 1616, par Nicolas Sruick en 1753,
par Tasman, Dampier, Fumel, Carteret, Edwards, Bougainville, Cook,
Forrest, Mac Cluer, par d’Entrecasteaux en 1792, par Duperrey en 1823, et
par Dumont d’Urville en 1827. « C’est le foyer des noirs qui occupent
toute la Malaisie ». a dit M. de Rienzi, et je ne me doutais guère que les
hasards de cette navigation allaient me mettre en présence des redoutables
Andamenes.
Le Nautilus se présenta donc à l’entrée du plus dangereux détroit du globe,
de celui que les plus hardis navigateurs osent à peine franchir, détroit que
Louis Paz de Torrès affronta en revenant des mers du Sud dans la
Mélanésie, et dans lequel, en 1840, les corvettes échouées de Dumont
d’Urville furent sur le point de se perdre corps et biens. Le Nautilus
lui−même, supérieur à tous les dangers de la mer, allait, cependant, faire
connaissance avec les récifs coralliens.
Le détroit de Torrès a environ trente−quatre lieues de large, mais il est
obstrué par une innombrable quantité d’îles, d’îlots, de brisants, de rochers,
qui rendent sa navigation presque impraticable. En conséquence, le
capitaine Nemo prit toutes les précautions voulues pour le traverser. Le
Nautilus, flottant à fleur d’eau, s’avançait sous une allure modérée. Son
hélice, comme une queue de cétacé, battait les flots avec lenteur.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 180
Profitant de cette situation, mes deux compagnons et moi, nous avions pris
place sur la plate−forme toujours déserte. Devant nous s’élevait la cage du
timonier, et je me trompe fort, ou le capitaine Nemo devait être là,
dirigeant lui−même son Nautilus.
J’avais sous les yeux les excellentes cartes du détroit de Torrès levées et
dressées par l’ingénieur hydrographe Vincendon Dumoulin et l’enseigne
de vaisseau Coupvent−Desbois – maintenant amiral qui faisaient partie de
l’état−major de Dumont d’Urville pendant son dernier voyage de
circumnavigation. Ce sont, avec celles du capitaine King, les meilleures
cartes qui débrouillent l’imbroglio de cet étroit passage, et je les consultais
avec une scrupuleuse attention.
Autour du Nautilus la mer bouillonnait avec furie. Le courant de flots, qui
portait du sud−est au nord−ouest avec une vitesse de deux milles et demi,
se brisait sur les coraux dont la tête émergeait çà et là.
« Voilà une mauvaise mer ! me dit Ned Land.
— Détestable, en effet, répondis−je, et qui ne convient guère à un bâtiment
comme le Nautilus.
— Il faut, reprit le Canadien, que ce damné capitaine soit bien certain de sa
route, car je vois là des pâtés de coraux qui mettraient sa coque en mille
pièces, si elle les effleurait seulement ! »
En effet, la situation était périlleuse, mais le Nautilus semblait se glisser
comme par enchantement au milieu de ces furieux écueils. Il ne suivait pas
exactement la route de l’Astrolabe et de la Zélée qui fut fatale à Dumont
d’Urville. Il prit plus au nord, rangea l’île Murray, et revint au sud−ouest,
vers le passage de Cumberland. Je croyais qu’il allait y donner
franchement, quand, remontant dans le nord−ouest, il se porta, à travers
une grande quantité d’îles et d’îlots peu connus, vers l’île Tound et le canal
Mauvais.
Je me demandais déjà si le capitaine Nemo, imprudent jusqu’à la folie,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 181
voulait engager son navire dans cette passe où touchèrent les deux
corvettes de Dumont d’Urville, quand, modifiant une seconde fois sa
direction et coupant droit à l’ouest, il se dirigea vers l’île Gueboroar.
Il était alors trois heures après−midi. Le flot se cassait, la marée étant
presque pleine. Le Nautilus s’approcha de cette île que je vois encore avec
sa remarquable lisière de pendanus. Nous la rangions à moins de deux
milles.
Soudain, un choc me renversa. Le Nautilus venait de toucher contre un
écueil, et il demeura immobile, donnant une légère gîte sur bâbord.
Quand je me relevai, j’aperçus sur la plate−forme le capitaine Nemo et son
second. Ils examinaient la situation du navire, échangeant quelques mots
dans leur incompréhensible idiome.
Voici quelle était cette situation. A deux milles, par tribord, apparaissait
l’île Gueboroar dont la côte s’arrondissait du nord à l’ouest, comme un
immense bras. Vers le sud et l’est se montraient déjà quelques têtes de
coraux que le jusant laissait à découvert. Nous nous étions échoués au
plein. et dans une de ces mers où les marées sont médiocres, circonstance
fâcheuse pour le renflouage du Nautilus. Cependant. Le navire n’avait
aucunement souffert, tant sa coque était solidement liée. Mais s’il ne
pouvait ni couler, ni s’ouvrir, il risquait fort d’être à jamais attaché sur ces
écueils, et alors c’en était fait de l’appareil sous−marin du capitaine Nemo.
Je réfléchissais ainsi, quand le capitaine, froid et calme, toujours maître de
lui, ne paraissant ni ému ni contrarié, s’approcha :
« Un accident ? lui dis−je.
— Non, un incident, me répondit−il.
— Mais un incident, répliquai−je, qui vous obligera peut−être à redevenir
un habitant de ces terres que vous fuyez ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 182
Le capitaine Nemo me regarda d’un air singulier. et fit un geste négatif.
C’était me dire assez clairement que rien ne le forcerait jamais à remettre
les pieds sur un continent. Puis il dit :
« D’ailleurs, monsieur Aronnax, le Nautilus n’est pas en perdition. Il vous
transportera encore au milieu des merveilles de l’Océan. Notre voyage ne
fait que commencer, et je ne désire pas me priver si vite de l’honneur de
votre compagnie.
— Cependant, capitaine Nemo, repris−je sans relever la tournure ironique
de cette phrase, le Nautilus s’est échoué au moment de la pleine mer. Or,
les marées ne sont pas fortes dans le Pacifique, et, si vous ne pouvez
délester le Nautilus – ce qui me paraît impossible je ne vois pas comment il
sera renfloué.
— Les marées ne sont pas fortes dans le Pacifique, vous avez raison,
monsieur le professeur, répondit le capitaine Nemo, mais, au détroit de
Torrès, on trouve encore une différence d’un mètre et demi entre le niveau
des hautes et basses mers. C’est aujourd’hui le 4 janvier, et dans cinq jours
la pleine lune. Or, je serai bien étonné si ce complaisant satellite ne
soulève pas suffisamment ces masses d’eau, et ne me rend pas un service
que je ne veux devoir qu’à lui seul. »
Ceci dit, le capitaine Nemo, suivi de son second, redescendit à l’intérieur
du Nautilus. Quant au bâtiment, il ne bougeait plus et demeurait immobile.
comme si les polypes coralliens l’eussent déjà maçonné dans leur
indestructible ciment.
« Eh bien, monsieur ? me dit Ned Land, qui vint à moi après le départ du
capitaine.
Eh bien, ami Ned, nous attendrons tranquillement la marée du 9, car il
paraît que la lune aura la complaisance de nous remettre à flot.
— Tout simplement ?
— Tout simplement.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 183
— Et ce capitaine ne va pas mouiller ses ancres au large, mettre sa
machine sur ses chaînes, et tout faire pour se déhaler ?
Puisque la marée suffira ! » répondit simplement Conseil.
Le Canadien regarda Conseil, puis il haussa les épaules. C’était le marin
qui parlait en lui.
« Monsieur, répliqua−t−il, vous pouvez me croire quand je vous dis que ce
morceau de fer ne naviguera plus jamais ni sur ni sous les mers. Il n’est
bon qu’à vendre au poids. Je pense donc que le moment est venu de
fausser compagnie au capitaine Nemo.
— Ami Ned, répondis−je, je ne désespère pas comme vous de ce vaillant
Nautilus, et dans quatre jours nous saurons à quoi nous en tenir sur les
marées du Pacifique. D’ailleurs, le conseil de fuir pourrait être opportun si
nous étions en vue des côtes de l’Angleterre ou de la Provence, mais dans
les parages de la Papouasie, c’est autre chose, et il sera toujours temps d’en
venir à cette extrémité, si le Nautilus ne parvient pas à se relever, ce que je
regarderais comme un événement grave.
— Mais ne saurait−on tâter, au moins, de ce terrain ? reprit Ned Land.
Voilà une île. Sur cette île, il y a des arbres. Sous ces arbres. des animaux
terrestres, des porteurs de côtelettes et de roastbeefs, auxquels je donnerais
volontiers quelques coups de dents.
— Ici, l’ami Ned a raison, dit Conseil, et je me range à son avis. Monsieur
ne pourrait−il obtenir de son ami le capitaine Nemo de nous transporter à
terre, ne fût−ce que pour ne pas perdre l’habitude de fouler du pied les
parties solides de notre planète ?
— Je peux le lui demander, répondis−je, mais il refusera.
— Que monsieur se risque, dit Conseil, et nous saurons à quoi nous en
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 184
tenir sur l’amabilité du capitaine. »
A ma grande surprise, le capitaine Nemo m’accorda la permission que je
lui demandais, et il le fit avec beaucoup de grâce et d’empressement, sans
même avoir exigé de moi la promesse de revenir à bord. Mais une fuite à
travers les terres de la Nouvelle−Guinée eût été très périlleuse, et je
n’aurais pas conseillé à Ned Land de la tenter. Mieux valait être prisonnier
à bord du Nautilus, que de tomber entre les mains des naturels de la
Papouasie.
Le canot fut mis à notre disposition pour le lendemain matin. Je ne
cherchai pas à savoir si le capitaine Nemo nous accompagnerait. Je pensai
même qu’aucun homme de l’équipage ne nous serait donné, et que Ned
Land serait seul chargé de diriger l’embarcation. D’ailleurs, la terre se
trouvait à deux milles au plus, et ce n’était qu’un jeu pour le Canadien de
conduire ce léger canot entre les lignes de récifs si fatales aux grands
navires.
Le lendemain, 5 janvier, le canot, déponté, fut arraché de son alvéole et
lancé à la mer du haut de la plate−forme. Deux hommes suffirent à cette
opération. Les avirons étaient dans l’embarcation, et nous n’avions plus
qu’à y prendre place.
A huit heures, armés de fusils et de haches, nous débordions du Nautilus.
La mer était assez calme. Une petite brise soufflait de terre. Conseil et moi,
placés aux avirons, nous nagions vigoureusement, et Ned gouvernait dans
les étroites passes que les brisants laissaient entre eux. Le canot se maniait
bien et filait rapidement.
Ned Land ne pouvait contenir sa joie. C’était un prisonnier échappé de sa
prison, et il ne songeait guère qu’il lui faudrait y rentrer.
« De la viande ! répétait−il, nous allons donc manger de la viande, et
quelle viande ! Du véritable gibier ! Pas de pain, par exemple ! Je ne dis
pas que le poisson ne soit une bonne chose, mais il ne faut pas en abuser, et
un morceau de fraîche venaison, grillé sur des charbons ardents, variera
agréablement notre ordinaire.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 185
— Gourmand ! répondait Conseil, il m’en fait venir l’eau à la bouche.
— Il reste à savoir, dis−je, si ces forêts sont giboyeuses, et si le gibier n’y
est pas de telle taille qu’il puisse lui−même chasser le chasseur.
— Bon ! monsieur Aronnax, répondit le Canadien, dont les dents
semblaient être affûtées comme un tranchant de hache, mais je mangerai
du tigre, de l’aloyau de tigre, s’il n’y a pas d’autre quadrupède dans cette
île.
— L’ami Ned est inquiétant, répondit Conseil.
— Quel qu’il soit, reprit Ned Land, tout animal à quatre pattes sans
plumes, ou à deux pattes avec plumes, sera salué de mon premier coup de
fusil.
— Bon ! répondis−je, voilà les imprudences de maître Land qui vont
recommencer !
— N’ayez pas peur, monsieur Aronnax, répondit le Canadien, et nagez
ferme ! Je ne demande pas vingt−cinq minutes pour vous offrir un mets de
ma façon. »
A huit heures et demie, le canot du Nautilus venait s’échouer doucement
sur une grève de sable, après avoir heureusement franchi l’anneau
coralligène qui entourait l’île de Gueboroar.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le détroit de Torrès 186
Quelques jours à terre
Je fus assez vivement impressionné en touchant terre. Ned Land essayait le
sol du pied, comme pour en prendre possession. Il n’y avait pourtant que
deux mois que nous étions, suivant l’expression du capitaine Nemo, les «
passagers du Nautilus », c’est−à−dire, en réalité, les prisonniers de son
commandant.
En quelques minutes. nous fûmes à une portée de fusil de la côte. Le sol
était presque entièrement madréporique, mais certains lits de torrents
desséchés. semés de débris granitiques, démontraient que cette île était due
à une formation primordiale. Tout l’horizon se cachait derrière un rideau
de forêts admirables. Des arbres énormes, dont la taille atteignait parfois
deux cents pieds, se reliaient l’un à l’autre par des guirlandes de lianes,
vrais hamacs naturels que berçait une brise légère. C’étaient des mimosas,
des ficus, des casuarinas, des teks, des hibiscus, des pendanus, des
palmiers, mélangés à profusion, et sous l’abri de leur voûte verdoyante, au
pied de leur stype gigantesque, croissaient des orchidées des légumineuses
et des fougères.
Mais, sans remarquer tous ces beaux échantillons de la flore papouasienne,
le Canadien abandonna l’agréable pour l’utile. Il aperçut un cocotier,
abattit quelques−uns de ses fruits, les brisa, et nous bûmes leur lait, nous
mangeâmes leur amande, avec une satisfaction qui protestait contre
l’ordinaire du Nautilus.
« Excellent ! disait Ned Land.
— Exquis ! répondait Conseil.
— Et je ne pense pas, dit le Canadien. que votre Nemo s’oppose à ce que
nous introduisions une cargaison de cocos à son bord ?
Quelques jours à terre 187
— Je ne le crois pas, répondis−je, mais il n’y voudra pas goûter !
— Tant pis pour lui ! dit Conseil.
— Et tant mieux pour nous ! riposta Ned Land. Il en restera davantage.
— Un mot seulement, maître Land, dis−je au harponneur qui se disposait à
ravager un autre cocotier, le coco est une bonne chose, mais avant d’en
remplir le canot, il me paraît sage de reconnaître si l’île ne produit pas
quelque substance non moins utile. Des légumes frais seraient bien reçus à
l’office du Nautilus.
— Monsieur a raison, répondit Conseil, et je propose de réserver trois
places dans notre embarcation, l’une pour les fruits, l’autre pour les
légumes, et la troisième pour la venaison, dont je n’ai pas encore entrevu le
plus mince échantillon.
— Conseil, il ne faut désespérer de rien, répondit le Canadien.
— Continuons donc notre excursion, repris−je, mais ayons l’oeil aux
aguets. Quoique l’île paraisse inhabitée, elle pourrait renfermer, cependant,
quelques individus qui seraient moins difficiles que nous sur la nature du
gibier !
— Hé ! hé ! fit Ned Land, avec un mouvement de mâchoire très
significatif.
— Eh bien ! Ned ! s’écria Conseil.
— Ma foi, riposta le Canadien, je commence à comprendre les charmes de
l’anthropophagie !
— Ned ! Ned ! que dites−vous là ! répliqua Conseil. Vous,
anthropophage ! Mais je ne serai plus en sûreté près de vous, moi qui
partage votre cabine ! Devrai−je donc me réveiller un jour à demi dévoré ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 188
— Ami Conseil, je vous aime beaucoup, mais pas assez pour vous manger
sans nécessité.
— Je ne m’y fie pas, répondit Conseil. En chasse ! Il faut absolument
abattre quelque gibier pour satisfaire ce cannibale, ou bien, l’un de ces
matins, monsieur ne trouvera plus que des morceaux de domestique pour le
servir. »
Tandis que s’échangeaient ces divers propos, nous pénétrions sous les
sombres voûtes de la forêt, et pendant deux heures, nous la parcourûmes en
tous sens.
Le hasard servit à souhait cette recherche de végétaux comestibles, et l’un
des plus utiles produits des zones tropicales nous fournit un aliment
précieux qui manquait à bord.
Je veux parler de l’arbre à pain, très abondant dans l’île Gueboroar, et j’y
remarquai principalement cette variété dépourvue de graines, qui porte en
malais le nom de « Rima ».
Cet arbre se distinguait des autres arbres par un tronc droit et haut de
quarante pieds. Sa cime, gracieusement arrondie et formée de grandes
feuilles multilobées, désignait suffisamment aux yeux d’un naturaliste cet
« artocarpus » qui a été très heureusement naturalisé aux îles
Mascareignes. De sa masse de verdure se détachaient de gros fruits
globuleux, larges d’un décimètre, et pourvus extérieurement de rugosités
qui prenaient une disposition hexagonale. Utile végétal dont la nature a
gratifie les régions auxquelles le blé manque, et qui, sans exiger aucune
culture, donne des fruits pendant huit mois de l’année.
Ned Land les connaissait bien, ces fruits. Il en avait déjà mangé pendant
ses nombreux voyages, et il savait préparer leur substance comestible.
Aussi leur vue excita−t−elle ses désirs, et il n’y put tenir plus longtemps.
« Monsieur, me dit−il, que je meure si je ne goûte pas un peu de cette pâte
de l’arbre à pain !
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 189
— Goûtez, ami Ned, goûtez à votre aise. Nous sommes ici pour faire des
expériences, faisons−les.
— Ce ne sera pas long », répondit le Canadien.
Et, armé d’une lentille, il alluma un feu de bois mort qui pétilla
joyeusement. Pendant ce temps, Conseil et moi, nous choisissions les
meilleurs fruits de l’artocarpus. Quelques−uns n’avaient pas encore atteint
un degré suffisant de maturité, et leur peau épaisse recouvrait une pulpe
blanche, mais peu fibreuse. D’autres, en très grand nombre, jaunâtres et
gélatineux, n’attendaient que le moment d’être cueillis.
Ces fruits ne renfermaient aucun noyau. Conseil en apporta une douzaine à
Ned Land, qui les plaça sur un feu de charbons, après les avoir coupés en
tranches épaisses, et ce faisant, il répétait toujours :
« Vous verrez, monsieur, comme ce pain est bon !
— Surtout quand on en est privé depuis longtemps, dit Conseil.
— Ce n’est même plus du pain, ajouta le Canadien. C’est une pâtisserie
délicate. Vous n’en avez jamais mange, monsieur ?
— Non, Ned.
— Eh bien, préparez−vous à absorber une chose succulente. Si vous n’y
revenez pas, je ne suis plus le roi des harponneurs ! »
Au bout de quelques minutes, la partie des fruits exposée au feu fut
complètement charbonnée. A l’intérieur apparaissait une pâte blanche,
sorte de mie tendre, dont la saveur rappelait celle de l’artichaut.
Il faut l’avouer, ce pain était excellent, et j’en mangeai avec grand plaisir.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 190
« Malheureusement, dis−je, une telle pâte ne peut se garder fraîche, et il
me paraît inutile d’en faire une provision pour le bord.
— Par exemple, monsieur ! s’écria Ned Land. Vous parlez là comme un
naturaliste, mais moi, je vais agir comme un boulanger. Conseil, faites une
récolte de ces fruits que nous reprendrons à notre retour.
— Et comment les préparerez−vous ? demandai−je au Canadien.
— En fabriquant avec leur pulpe une pâte fermentée qui se gardera
indéfiniment et sans se corrompre. Lorsque je voudrai l’employer, je la
ferai cuire à la cuisine du bord, et malgré sa saveur un peu acide, vous la
trouverez excellente.
— Alors, maître Ned, je vois qu’il ne manque rien à ce pain...
— Si, monsieur le professeur, répondit le Canadien, il y manque quelques
fruits ou tout ou moins quelques légumes !
Cherchons les fruits et les légumes. »
Lorsque notre récolte fut terminée, nous nous mîmes en route pour
compléter ce dîner « terrestre ».
Nos recherches ne furent pas vaines, et, vers midi, nous avions fait une
ample provision de bananes. Ces produits délicieux de la zone torride
mûrissent pendant toute l’année, et les Malais, qui leur ont donné le nom
de « pisang », les mangent sans les faire cuire. Avec ces bananes, nous
recueillîmes des jaks énormes dont le goût est très accusé, des mangues
savoureuses, et des ananas d’un grosseur invraisemblable. Mais cette
récolte prit une grande partie de notre temps, que, d’ailleurs, il n’y avait
pas lieu de regretter.
Conseil observait toujours Ned. Le harponneur marchait en avant, et,
pendant sa promenade à travers la forêt, il glanait d’une main sûre
d’excellents fruits qui devaient compléter sa provision.

« Enfin, demanda Conseil, il ne vous manque plus rien, ami Ned ?
— Hum ! fit le Canadien.
— Quoi ! vous vous plaignez ?
— Tous ces végétaux ne peuvent constituer un repas, répondit Ned. C’est
la fin d’un repas, c’est un dessert. Mais le potage ? mais le rôti ?
— En effet, dis−je, Ned nous avait promis des côtelettes qui me semblent
fort problématiques.
— Monsieur, répondit le Canadien, non seulement la chasse n’est pas finie,
mais elle n’est même pas commencée. Patience ! Nous finirons bien par
rencontrer quelque animal de plume ou de poil, et, si ce n’est pas en cet
endroit, ce sera dans un autre...
— Et si ce n’est pas aujourd’hui, ce sera demain, ajouta Conseil, car il ne
faut pas trop s’éloigner. Je propose même de revenir au canot.
— Quoi ! déjà ! s’écria Ned.
— Nous devons être de retour avant la nuit, dis−je.
— Mais quelle heure est−il donc ? demanda le Canadien.
— Deux heures, au moins, répondit Conseil.
— Comme le temps passe sur ce sol ferme ! s’écria maître Ned Land avec
un soupir de regret.
— En route », répondit Conseil.
Nous revînmes donc à travers la forêt, et nous complétâmes notre récolte
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 192
en faisant une razzia de chouxpalmistes qu’il fallut cueillir à la cime des
arbres, de petits haricots que je reconnus pour être les « abrou » des
Malais, et d’ignames d’une qualité supérieure.
Nous étions surchargés quand nous arrivâmes au canot. Cependant, Ned
Land ne trouvait pas encore sa provision suffisante. Mais le sort le
favorisa. Au moment de s’embarquer, il aperçut plusieurs arbres, hauts de
vingt−cinq à trente pieds, qui appartenaient à l’espèce des palmiers. Ces
arbres, aussi précieux que l’artocarpus, sont justement comptés parmi les
plus utiles produits de la Malaisie.
C’étaient des sagoutiers, végétaux qui croissent sans culture, se
reproduisant, comme les mûriers, par leurs rejetons et leurs graines.
Ned Land connaissait la manière de traiter ces arbres. Il prit sa hache, et la
maniant avec une grande vigueur, il eut bientôt couché sur le sol deux ou
trois sagoutiers dont la maturité se reconnaissait à la poussière blanche qui
saupoudrait leurs palmes.
Je le regardai faire plutôt avec les yeux d’un naturaliste qu’avec les yeux
d’un homme affamé. Il commença par enlever à chaque tronc une bande
d’écorce, épaisse d’un pouce, qui recouvrait un réseau de fibres allongées
formant d’inextricables noeuds, que mastiquait une sorte de farine
gommeuse. Cette farine, c’était le sagou, substance comestible qui sert
principalement à l’alimentation des populations mélanésiennes.
Ned Land se contenta, pour le moment, de couper ces troncs par morceaux,
comme il eût fait de bois à brûler, se réservant d’en extraire plus tard la
farine, de la passer dans une étoffe afin de la séparer de ses ligaments
fibreux, d’en faire évaporer l’humidité au soleil, et de la laisser durcir dans
des moules.
Enfin, à cinq heures du soir, chargés de toutes nos richesses, nous quittions
le rivage de l’île, et, une demi−heure après, nous accostions le Nautilus.
Personne ne parut à notre arrivée. L’énorme cylindre de tôle semblait
désert. Les provisions embarquées, je descendis à ma chambre. J’y trouvai
mon souper prêt. Je mangeai, puis je m’endormis.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 193
Le lendemain, 6 janvier, rien de nouveau à bord. Pas un bruit à l’intérieur,
pas un signe de vie. Le canot était resté le long du bord, à la place même
où nous l’avions laissé. Nous résolûmes de retourner à l’île Gueboroar.
Ned Land espérait être plus heureux que la veille au point de vue du
chasseur, et désirait visiter une autre partie de la forêt.
Au lever du soleil, nous étions en route. L’embarcation, enlevée par le flot
qui portait à terre, atteignit l’île en peu d’instants.
Nous débarquâmes, et, pensant qu’il valait mieux s’en rapporter à l’instinct
du Canadien, nous suivîmes Ned Land dont les longues jambes menaçaient
de nous distancer.
Ned Land remonta la côte vers l’ouest, puis, passant à gué quelques lits de
torrents, il gagna la haute plaine que bordaient d’admirables forêts.
Quelques martins−pêcheurs rôdaient le long des cours d’eau, mais ils ne se
laissaient pas approcher. Leur circonspection me prouva que ces volatiles
savaient à quoi s’en tenir sur des bipèdes de notre espèce, et j’en conclus
que, si l’île n’était pas habitée, du moins, des êtres humains la
fréquentaient.
Après avoir traversé une assez grasse prairie, nous arrivâmes à la lisière
d’un petit bois qu’animaient le chant et le vol d’un grand nombre
d’oiseaux.
« Ce ne sont encore que des oiseaux, dit Conseil.
— Mais il y en a qui se mangent ! répondit le harponneur.
— Point, ami Ned, répliqua Conseil, car je ne vois là que de simples
perroquets.
— Ami Conseil, répondit gravement Ned, le perroquet est le faisan de ceux
qui n’ont pas autre chose à manger.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 194
— Et j’ajouterai, dis−je, que cet oiseau, convenablement préparé, vaut son
coup de fourchette. »
En effet, sous l’épais feuillage de ce bois, tout un monde de perroquets
voltigeait de branche en branche, n’attendant qu’une éducation plus
soignée pour parler la langue humaine. Pour le moment, ils caquetaient en
compagnie de perruches de toutes couleurs, de graves kakatouas, qui
semblaient méditer quelque problème philosophique, tandis que des loris
d’un rouge éclatant passaient comme un morceau d’étamine emporté par la
brise, au milieu de kalaos au vol bruyant, de papouas peints des plus fines
nuances de l’azur, et de toute une variété de volatiles charmants, mais
généralement peu comestibles.
Cependant, un oiseau particulier à ces terres, et qui n’a jamais dépassé la
limite des îles d’Arrou et des îles des Papouas, manquait à cette collection.
Mais le sort me réservait de l’admirer avant peu.
Après avoir traversé un taillis de médiocre épaisseur, nous avions retrouvé
une plaine obstruée de buissons. Je vis alors s’enlever de magnifiques
oiseaux que la disposition de leurs longues plumes obligeait à se diriger
contre le vent. Leur vol ondulé, la grâce de leurs courbes aériennes, le
chatoiement de leurs couleurs, attiraient et charmaient le regard. Je n’eus
pas de peine à les reconnaître.
« Des oiseaux de paradis ! m’écriai−je.
— Ordre des passereaux, section des clystomores, répondit Conseil.
— Famille des perdreaux ? demanda Ned Land.
— Je ne crois pas, maître Land. Néanmoins, je compte sur votre adresse
pour attraper un de ces charmants produits de la nature tropicale !
— On essayera, monsieur le professeur, quoique je sois plus habitué à
manier le harpon que le fusil. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 195
Les Malais, qui font un grand commerce de ces oiseaux avec les Chinois,
ont, pour les prendre, divers moyens que nous ne pouvions employer.
Tantôt ils disposent des lacets au sommet des arbres élevés que les
paradisiers habitent de préférence. Tantôt ils s’en emparent avec une glu
tenace qui paralyse leurs mouvements. Ils vont même jusqu’à empoisonner
les fontaines où ces oiseaux ont l’habitude de boire. Quant à nous, nous
étions réduits à les tirer au vol, ce qui nous laissait peu de chances de les
atteindre. Et en effet, nous épuisâmes vainement une partie de nos
munitions.
Vers onze heures du matin, le premier plan des montagnes qui forment le
centre de l’île était franchi, et nous n’avions encore rien tué. La faim nous
aiguillonnait. Les chasseurs s’étaient fiés au produit de leur chasse, et ils
avaient eu tort. Très heureusement, Conseil, à sa grande surprise, fit un
coup double et assura le déjeuner. Il abattit un pigeon blanc et un ramier,
qui, lestement plumés et suspendus à une brochette, rôtirent devant un feu
ardent de bois mort. Pendant que ces intéressants animaux cuisaient, Ned
prépara des fruits de l’artocarpus. Puis, le pigeon et le ramier furent
dévorés jusqu’aux os et déclarés excellents. La muscade, dont ils ont
l’habitude de se gaver, parfume leur chair et en fait un manger délicieux.
« C’est comme si les poulardes se nourrissaient de truffes, dit Conseil.
— Et maintenant, Ned. que vous manque−t−il ? demandai−je au Canadien.
— Un gibier à quatre pattes, monsieur Aronnax, répondit Ned Land. Tous
ces pigeons ne sont que hors−d’oeuvre et amusettes de la bouche. Aussi,
tant que je n’aurai pas tué un animal à côtelettes, je ne serai pas content !
— Ni moi, Ned, si je n’attrape pas un paradisier.
— Continuons donc la chasse, répondit Conseil, mais en revenant vers la
mer. Nous sommes arrivés aux premières pentes des montagnes, et je
pense qu’il vaut mieux regagner la région des forêts. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 196
C’était un avis sensé, et il fut suivi. Après une heure de marche, nous
avions atteint une véritable forêt de sagoutiers. Quelques serpents
inoffensifs fuyaient sous nos pas. Les oiseaux de paradis se dérobaient à
notre approche, et véritablement, je désespérais de les atteindre, lorsque
Conseil, qui marchait en avant, se baissa soudain, poussa un cri de
triomphe, et revint à moi, rapportant un magnifique paradisier.
« Ah ! bravo ! Conseil, m’écriai−je.
— Monsieur est bien bon, répondit Conseil.
— Mais non, mon garçon. Tu as fait là un coup de maître. Prendre un de
ces oiseaux vivants, et le prendre à la main !
— Si monsieur veut l’examiner de près, il verra que je n’ai pas eu grand
mérite.
— Et pourquoi, Conseil ?
— Parce que cet oiseau est ivre comme une caille.
— Ivre ?
— Oui, monsieur, ivre des muscades qu’il dévorait sous le muscadier où je
l’ai pris. Voyez, ami Ned, voyez les monstrueux effets de l’intempérance !
— Mille diables ! riposta le Canadien, pour ce que j’ai bu de gin depuis
deux mois, ce n’est pas la peine de me le reprocher !»
Cependant, j’examinais le curieux oiseau. Conseil ne se trompait pas. Le
paradisier, enivré par le suc capiteux, était réduit à l’impuissance. Il ne
pouvait voler. Il marchait à peine. Mais cela m’inquiéta peu, et je le laissai
cuver ses muscades.
Cet oiseau appartenait à la plus belle des huit espèces que l’on compte en
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 197
Papouasie et dans les îles voisines. C’était le paradisier « grand−émeraude
», l’un des plus rares. Il mesurait trois décimètres de longueur. Sa tête était
relativement petite, ses yeux placés près de l’ouverture du bec, et petits
aussi. Mais il offrait une admirable réunion de nuances. étant jaune de bec,
brun de pieds et d’ongles, noisette aux ailes empourprées à leurs
extrémités, jaune pâle à la tête et sur le derrière du cou, couleur
d’émeraude à la gorge, brun marron au ventre et à la poitrine. Deux filets
cornés et duveteux s’élevaient au−dessus de sa queue, que prolongeaient
de longues plumes très légères, d’une finesse admirable, et ils complétaient
l’ensemble de ce merveilleux oiseau que les indigènes ont poétiquement
appelé 1’ "oiseau du soleil".
Je souhaitais vivement de pouvoir ramener à Paris ce superbe spécimen
des paradisiers, afin d’en faire don au Jardin des Plantes, qui n’en possède
pas un seul vivant.
« C’est donc bien rare ? demanda le Canadien, du ton d’un chasseur qui
estime fort peu le gibier au point de vue de l’art.
— Très rare, mon brave compagnon, et surtout très difficile à prendre
vivant. Et même morts, ces oiseaux sont encore l’objet d’un important
trafic. Aussi, les naturels ont−ils imaginé d’en fabriquer comme on
fabrique des perles ou des diamants.
— Quoi ! s’écria Conseil, on fait de faux oiseaux de paradis ?
— Oui, Conseil.
— Et monsieur connaît−il le procédé des indigènes ?
— Parfaitement. Les paradisiers, pendant la mousson d’est, perdent ces
magnifiques plumes qui entourent leur queue, et que les naturalistes ont
appelées plumes subalaires. Ce sont ces plumes que recueillent les
faux−monnayeurs en volatiles, et qu’ils adaptent adroitement à quelque
pauvre perruche préalablement mutilée. Puis ils teignent la suture, ils
vernissent l’oiseau, et ils expédient aux muséums et aux amateurs
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 198
d’Europe ces produits de leur singulière industrie.
— Bon ! fit Ned Land, si ce n’est pas l’oiseau, ce sont toujours ses plumes,
et tant que l’objet n’est pas destiné à être mangé. je n’y vois pas grand
mal ! »
Mais si mes désirs étaient satisfaits par la possession de ce paradisier, ceux
du chasseur canadien ne l’étaient pas encore. Heureusement, vers deux
heures, Ned Land abattit un magnifique cochon des bois, de ceux que les
naturels appellent « bari−outang ». L’animal venait à propos pour nous
procurer de la vraie viande de quadrupède, et il fut bien reçu. Ned Land se
montra très glorieux de son coup de fusil. Le cochon, touché par la balle
électrique, était tombé raide mort.
Le Canadien le dépouilla et le vida proprement, après en avoir retiré une
demi−douzaine de côtelettes destinées à fournir une grillade pour le repas
du soir. Puis, cette chasse fut reprise, qui devait encore être marquée par
les exploits de Ned et de Conseil.
En effet, les deux amis, battant les buissons, firent lever une troupe de
kangaroos, qui s’enfuirent en bondissant sur leurs pattes élastiques. Mais
ces animaux ne s’enfuirent pas si rapidement que la capsule électrique ne
put les arrêter dans leur course.
« Ah ! monsieur le professeur, s’écria Ned Land que la rage du chasseur
prenait à la tête, quel gibier excellent, cuit à l’étuvée surtout ! Quel
approvisionnement pour le Nautilus ! Deux ! trois ! cinq à terre ! Et quand
je pense que nous dévorerons toute cette chair, et que ces imbéciles du
bord n’en auront pas miette ! »
Je crois que, dans l’excès de sa joie, le Canadien, s’il n’avait pas tant parlé,
aurait massacré toute la bande ! Mais il se contenta d’une douzaine de ces
intéressants marsupiaux, qui forment le premier ordre des mammifères
aplacentaires – nous dit Conseil.
Ces animaux étaient de petite taille. C’était une espèce de ces «
kangaroos−lapins », qui gîtent habituellement dans le creux des arbres, et
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 199
dont la vélocité est extrême ; mais s’ils sont de médiocre grosseur, ils
fournissent, du moins, la chair la plus estimée.
Nous étions très satisfaits des résultats de notre chasse. Le joyeux Ned se
proposait de revenir le lendemain à cette île enchantée, qu’il voulait
dépeupler de tous ses quadrupèdes comestibles. Mais il comptait sans les
événements.
A six heures du soir, nous avions regagné la plage. Notre canot était
échoué à sa place habituelle. Le Nautilus, semblable à un long écueil,
émergeait des flots à deux milles du rivage.
Ned Land, sans plus tarder, s’occupa de la grande affaire du dîner. Il
s’entendait admirablement à toute cette cuisine. Les côtelettes de «
bari−outang », grillées sur des charbons, répandirent bientôt une délicieuse
odeur qui parfuma l’atmosphère ! ...
Mais je m’aperçois que je marche sur les traces du Canadien. Me voici en
extase devant une grillade de porc frais ! Que l’on me pardonne, comme
j’ai pardonné à maître Land, et pour les mêmes motifs !
Enfin, le dîner fut excellent. Deux ramiers complétèrent ce menu
extraordinaire. La pâte de sagou, le pain de l’artocarpus, quelques
mangues, une demi−douzaine d’ananas, et la liqueur fermentée de
certaines noix de cocos, nous mirent en joie. Je crois même que les idées
de mes dignes compagnons n’avaient pas toute la netteté désirable.
« Si nous ne retournions pas ce soir au Nautilus ? dit Conseil.
Si nous n’y retournions jamais ? » ajouta Ned Land.
En ce moment une pierre vint tomber à nos pieds, et coupa court à la
proposition du harponneur.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Quelques jours à terre 200
La foudre du capitaine Nemo
Nous avions regardé du côté de la forêt, sans nous lever, ma main
s’arrêtant dans son mouvement vers ma bouche, celle de Ned Land
achevant son office.
« Une pierre ne tombe pas du ciel, dit Conseil, ou bien elle mérite le nom
d’aérolithe. »
Une seconde pierre, soigneusement arrondie, qui enleva de la main de
Conseil une savoureuse cuisse de ramier, donna encore plus de poids à son
observation.
Levés tous les trois, le fusil à l’épaule, nous étions prêts à répondre à toute
attaque.
« Sont−ce des singes ? s’écria Ned Land.
— A peu près, répondit Conseil, ce sont des sauvages.
— Au canot ! » dis−je en me dirigeant vers la mer.
Il fallait, en effet, battre en retraite, car une vingtaine de naturels, armés
d’arcs et de frondes, apparaissaient sur la lisière d’un taillis, qui masquait
l’horizon de droite, à cent pas à peine.
Notre canot était échoué à dix toises de nous.
Les sauvages s’approchaient, sans courir, mais ils prodiguaient les
démonstrations les plus hostiles. Les pierres et les flèches pleuvaient.
Ned Land n’avait pas voulu abandonner ses provisions, et malgré
l’imminence du danger, son cochon d’un côté, ses kangaroos de l’autre, il
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 201
détalait avec une certaine rapidité.
En deux minutes, nous étions sur la grève. Charger le canot des provisions
et des armes, le pousser à la mer, armer les deux avirons, ce fut l’affaire
d’un instant. Nous n’avions pas gagné deux encablures, que cent sauvages,
hurlant et gesticulant, entrèrent dans l’eau jusqu’à la ceinture. Je regardais
si leur apparition attirerait sur la plate−forme quelques hommes du
Nautilus. Mais non. L’énorme engin, couché au large, demeurait
absolument désert.
Vingt minutes plus tard, nous montions à bord. Les panneaux étaient
ouverts. Après avoir amarré le canot, nous rentrâmes à l’intérieur du
Nautilus.
Je descendis au salon, d’où s’échappaient quelques accords. Le capitaine
Nemo était là, courbé sur son orgue et plongé dans une extase musicale.
« Capitaine ! » lui dis−je.
Il ne m’entendit pas.
« Capitaine ! » repris−je en le touchant de la main.
Il frissonna, et se retournant :
« Ah ! c’est vous, monsieur le professeur ? me dit−il. Eh bien ! avez−vous
fait bonne chasse, avez−vous herborisé avec succès ?
— Oui, capitaine, répondis−je, mais nous avons malheureusement ramené
une troupe de bipèdes dont le voisinage me paraît inquiétant.
— Quels bipèdes ?
— Des sauvages.
— Des sauvages ! répondit le capitaine Nemo d’un ton ironique. Et vous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 202
vous étonnez, monsieur le professeur, qu’ayant mis le pied sur une des
terres de ce globe, vous y trouviez des sauvages ? Des sauvages, où n’y en
a−t−il pas ? Et d’ailleurs, sont−ils pires que les autres, ceux que vous
appelez des sauvages ?
— Mais, capitaine...
— Pour mon compte, monsieur, j’en ai rencontré partout.
— Eh bien, répondis−je, si vous ne voulez pas en recevoir à bord du
Nautilus, vous ferez bien de prendre quelques précautions.
— Tranquillisez−vous, monsieur le professeur, il n’y a pas là de quoi se
préoccuper.
— Mais ces naturels sont nombreux.
— Combien en avez−vous compté ?
— Une centaine, au moins.
— Monsieur Aronnax, répondit le capitaine Nemo, dont les doigts s’étaient
replacés sur les touches de l’orgue, quand tous les indigènes de la
Papouasie seraient réunis sur cette plage, le Nautilus n’aurait rien à
craindre de leurs attaques ! »
Les doigts du capitaine couraient alors sur le clavier de l’instrument, et je
remarquai qu’il n’en frappait que les touches noires, ce qui donnait à ses
mélodies une couleur essentiellement écossaise. Bientôt, il eut oublié ma
présence, et fut plongé dans une rêverie que je ne cherchai plus à dissiper.
Je remontai sur la plate−forme. La nuit était déjà venue, car, sous cette
basse latitude, le soleil se couche rapidement et sans crépuscule. Je
n’aperçus plus que confusément l’Ile Gueboroar. Mais des feux nombreux,
allumés sur la plage, attestaient que les naturels ne songeaient pas à la
quitter.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 203
Je restai seul ainsi pendant plusieurs heures, tantôt songeant ces indigènes
mais sans les redouter autrement, car l’imperturbable confiance du
capitaine me gagnait – tantôt les oubliant, pour admirer les splendeurs de
cette nuit des tropiques. Mon souvenir s’envolait vers la France, à la suite
de ces étoiles zodiacales qui devaient l’éclairer dans quelques heures. La
lune resplendissait au milieu des constellations du zénith. Je pensai alors
que ce fidèle et complaisant satellite reviendrait après−demain, à cette
même place, pour soulever ces ondes et arracher le Nautilus à son lit de
coraux. Vers minuit, voyant que tout était tranquille sur les flots assombris
aussi bien que sous les arbres du rivage, je regagnai ma cabine, et je
m’endormis paisiblement.
La nuit s’écoula sans mésaventure. Les Papouas s’effrayaient, sans doute, à
la seule vue du monstre échoué dans la baie, car, les panneaux, restés
ouverts, leur eussent offert un accès facile à l’intérieur du Nautilus.
A six heures du matin – 8 janvier je remontai sur la plate−forme. Les
ombres du matin se levaient. L’île montra bientôt, à travers les brumes
dissipées, ses plages d’abord, ses sommets ensuite.
Les indigènes étaient toujours là, plus nombreux que la veille – cinq ou six
cents peut−être. Quelques−uns, profitant de la marée basse, s’étaient
avancés sur les têtes de coraux, à moins de deux encablures du Nautilus. Je
les distinguai facilement. C’étaient bien de véritables Papouas, à taille
athlétique, hommes de belle race, au front large et élevé, au nez gros mais
non épaté, aux dents blanches. Leur chevelure laineuse, teinte en rouge,
tranchait sur un corps, noir et luisant comme celui des Nubiens. Au lobe de
leur oreille, coupé et distendu, pendaient des chapelets en os. Ces sauvages
étaient généralement nus. Parmi eux, je remarquai quelques femmes,
habillées, des hanches au genou, d’une véritable crinoline d’herbes que
soutenait une ceinture végétale. Certains chefs avaient orné leur cou d’un
croissant et de colliers de verroteries rouges et blanches. Presque tous,
armés d’arcs, de flèches et de boucliers, portaient à leur épaule une sorte de
filet contenant ces pierres arrondies que leur fronde lance avec adresse.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 204
Un de ces chefs, assez rapproché du Nautilus, l’examinait avec attention.
Ce devait être un « mado » de haut rang, car il se drapait dans une natte en
feuilles de bananiers, dentelée sur ses bords et relevée d’éclatantes
couleurs.
J’aurais pu facilement abattre cet indigène, qui se trouvait à petite portée ;
mais je crus qu’il valait mieux attendre des démonstrations véritablement
hostiles. Entre Européens et sauvages, il convient que les Européens
ripostent et n’attaquent pas.
Pendant tout le temps de la marée basse, ces indigènes rôdèrent près du
Nautilus, mais ils ne se montrèrent pas bruyants. Je les entendais répéter
fréquemment le mot « assai », et à leurs gestes je compris qu’ils
m’invitaient à aller à terre, invitation que je crus devoir décliner.
Donc, ce jour−là, le canot ne quitta pas le bord, au grand déplaisir de
maître Land qui ne put compléter ses provisions. Cet adroit Canadien
employa son temps à préparer les viandes et farines qu’il avait rapportées
de l’île Gueboroar. Quant aux sauvages, ils regagnèrent la terre vers onze
heures du matin, dès que les têtes de corail commencèrent à disparaître
sous le flot de la marée montante. Mais je vis leur nombre s’accroître
considérablement sur la plage. Il était probable qu’ils venaient des îles
voisines ou de la Papouasie proprement dite. Cependant, je n’avais pas
aperçu une seule pirogue indigène.
N’ayant rien de mieux à faire, je songeai à draguer ces belles eaux
limpides, qui laissaient voir à profusion des coquilles, des zoophytes et des
plantes pélagiennes. C’était, d’ailleurs, la dernière journée que le Nautilus
allait passer dans ces parages, si, toutefois, il flottait à la pleine mer du
lendemain, suivant la promesse du capitaine Nemo.
J’appelai donc Conseil qui m’apporta une petite drague le gère, à peu près
semblable à celles qui servent à pêcher les huîtres.
« Et ces sauvages ? me demanda Conseil. N’en déplaise à monsieur, ils ne
me semblent pas très méchants !
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 205
— Ce sont pourtant des anthropophages, mon garçon.
— On peut être anthropophage et brave homme, répondit Conseil, comme
on peut être gourmand et honnête. L’un n’exclut pas l’autre.
— Bon ! Conseil, je t’accorde que ce sont d’honnêtes anthropophages, et
qu’ils dévorent honnêtement leurs prisonniers. Cependant, comme je ne
tiens pas à être dévoré, même honnêtement, je me tiendrai sur mes gardes,
car le
commandant du Nautilus ne paraît prendre aucune précaution. Et
maintenant à l’ouvrage. »
Pendant deux heures, notre pêche fut activement conduite, mais sans
rapporter aucune rareté. La drague s’emplissait d’oreilles de Midas, de
harpes, de mélanies, et particulièrement des plus beaux marteaux que
j’eusse vu jusqu’à ce jour. Nous prîmes aussi quelques holoturies, des
huîtres perlières, et une douzaine de petites tortues qui furent réservées
pour l’office du bord.
Mais, au moment où je m’y attendais le moins, je mis la main sur une
merveille, je devrais dire sur une difformité naturelle, très rare à
rencontrer. Conseil venait de donner un coup de drague, et son appareil
remontait chargé de diverses coquilles assez ordinaires, quand, tout d’un
coup, il me vit plonger rapidement le bras dans le filet, en retirer un
coquillage, et pousser un cri de conchyliologue, c’est−à−dire le cri le plus
perçant que puisse produire un gosier humain.
« Eh ! qu’a donc monsieur ? demanda Conseil, très surpris. Monsieur
a−t−il été mordu ?
— Non, mon garçon, et cependant, j’eusse volontiers payé d’un doigt ma
découverte !
— Quelle découverte ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 206
— Cette coquille, dis−je en montrant l’objet de mon triomphe.
— Mais c’est tout simplement une olive porphyre, genre olive, ordre des
pectinibranches, classe des gastéropodes, embranchement des
mollusques...
— Oui, Conseil, mais au lieu d’être enroulée de droite à gauche, cette olive
tourne de gauche à droite !
— Est−il possible ! s’écria Conseil.
— Oui, mon garçon, c’est une coquille sénestre !
— Une coquille sénestre ! répétait Conseil, le coeur palpitant.
— Regarde sa spire !
— Ah ! monsieur peut m’en croire, dit Conseil en prenant la précieuse
coquille d’une main tremblante, mais je n’ai jamais éprouvé une émotion
pareille ! »
Et il y avait de quoi être ému ! On sait, en effet, comme l’ont fait observer
les naturalistes, que la dextrosité est une loi de nature. Les astres et leurs
satellites, dans leur mouvement de translation et de rotation, se meuvent de
droite à gauche. L’homme se sert plus souvent de sa main droite que de sa
main gauche, et, conséquemment, ses instruments et ses appareils,
escaliers, serrures, ressorts de montres, etc. , sont combinés de manière a
être employés de droite à gauche. Or, la nature a généralement suivi cette
loi pour l’enroulement de ses coquilles. Elles sont toutes dextres, à de rares
exceptions, et quand, par hasard, leur spire est sénestre, les amateurs les
payent au poids de l’or.
Conseil et moi, nous étions donc plongés dans la contemplation de notre
trésor, et je me promettais bien d’en enrichir le Muséum, quand une pierre,
malencontreusement lancée par un indigène, vint briser le précieux objet
dans la main de Conseil.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 207
Je poussai un cri de désespoir ! Conseil se jeta sur mon fusil, et visa un
sauvage qui balançait sa fronde à dix mètres de lui. Je voulus l’arrêter,
mais son coup partit et brisa le bracelet d’amulettes qui pendait au bras de
l’indigène.
« Conseil, m’écriai−je, Conseil !
— Eh quoi ! Monsieur ne voit−il pas que ce cannibale a commencé
l’attaque ?
— Une coquille ne vaut pas la vie d’un homme ! lui dis−je.
— Ah ! le gueux ! s’écria Conseil, j’aurais mieux aimé qu’il m’eût cassé
l’épaule ! »
Conseil était sincère, mais je ne fus pas de son avis. Cependant, la situation
avait changé depuis quelques instants, et nous ne nous en étions pas
aperçus. Une vingtaine de pirogues entouraient alors le Naulilus. Ces
pirogues, creusées dans des troncs d’arbre, longues, étroites, bien
combinées pour la marche, s’équilibraient au moyen d’un double balancier
en bambous qui flottait à la surface de l’eau. Elles étaient manoeuvrées par
d’adroits pagayeurs à demi nus, et je ne les vis pas s’avancer sans
inquiétude.
C’était évident que ces Papouas avaient eu déjà des relations avec les
Européens, et qu’ils connaissaient leurs navires. Mais ce long cylindre de
fer allongé dans la baie, sans mâts, sans cheminée, que devaient−ils en
penser ? Rien de bon, car ils s’en étaient d’abord tenus à distance
respectueuse. Cependant. Le voyant immobile, ils reprenaient peu à peu
confiance, et cherchaient à se familiariser avec lui. Or, c’était précisément
cette familiarité qu’il fallait empêcher. Nos armes, auxquelles la détonation
manquait, ne pouvaient produire qu’un effet médiocre sur ces indigènes.
qui n’ont de respect que pour les engins bruyants. La foudre, sans les
roulements du tonnerre, effraierait peu les hommes, bien que le danger soit
dans l’éclair, non dans le bruit.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 208
En ce moment, les pirogues s’approchèrent plus près du Nautilus, et une
nuée de flèches s’abattit sur lui.
« Diable ! il grêle ! dit Conseil, et peut−être une grêle empoisonnée !
— Il faut prévenir le capitaine Nemo », dis−je en rentrant par le panneau.
Je descendis au salon. Je n’y trouvai personne. Je me hasardai à frapper à
la porte qui s’ouvrait sur la chambre du capitaine.
Un « entrez » me répondit. J’entrai, et je trouvai le capitaine Nemo plongé
dans un calcul où les x et autres signes algébriques ne manquaient pas.
« Je vous dérange ? dis−je par politesse.
— En effet, monsieur Aronnax, me répondit le capitaine, mais je pense que
vous avez eu des raisons sérieuses de me voir ?
— Très sérieuses. Les pirogues des naturels nous entourent, et, dans
quelques minutes, nous serons certainement assaillis par plusieurs
centaines de sauvages.
— Ah ! fit tranquillement le capitaine Nemo, ils sont venus avec leurs
pirogues ?
— Oui, monsieur.
— Eh bien, monsieur, il suffit de fermer les panneaux.
— Précisément, et je venais vous dire...
— Rien n’est plus facile », dit le capitaine Nemo.
Et, pressant un bouton électrique, il transmit un ordre au poste de
l’équipage.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 209
« Voilà qui est fait, monsieur, me dit−il, après quelques instants. Le canot
est en place, et les panneaux sont fermés. Vous ne craignez pas, j’imagine,
que ces messieurs défoncent des murailles que les boulets de votre frégate
n’ont pu entamer ?
— Non, capitaine, mais il existe encore un danger.
— Lequel, monsieur ?
— C’est que demain, à pareille heure, il faudra rouvrir les panneaux pour
renouveler l’air du Nautilus...
— Sans contredit, monsieur, puisque notre bâtiment respire à la manière
des cétacés.
— Or, si à ce moment, les Papouas occupent la plate−forme, je ne vois pas
comment vous pourrez les empêcher d’entrer.
— Alors, monsieur, vous supposez qu’ils monteront à bord ?
— J’en suis certain.
— Eh bien, monsieur, qu’ils montent. Je ne vois aucune raison pour les en
empêcher. Au fond, ce sont de pauvres diables, ces Papouas, et je ne veux
pas que ma visite à l’île Gueboroar coûte la vie à un seul de ces
malheureux ! »
Cela dit, j’allais me retirer ; mais le capitaine Nemo me retint et m’invita à
m’asseoir près de lui. Il me questionna avec intérêt sur nos excursions à
terre, sur nos chasses, et n’eut pas l’air de comprendre ce besoin de viande
qui passionnait le Canadien. Puis, la conversation effleura divers sujets, et,
sans être plus communicatif, le capitaine Nemo se montra plus aimable.
Entre autres choses, nous en vînmes à parler de la situation du Nautilus,
précisément échoué dans ce détroit, où Dumont d’Urville fut sur le point
de se perdre. Puis à ce propos :
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 210
« Ce fut un de vos grands marins, me dit le capitaine, un de vos plus
intelligents navigateurs que ce d’Urville ! C’est votre capitaine Cook, à
vous autres, Français. Infortuné savant ! Avoir bravé les banquises du pôle
Sud, les coraux de l’Océanie, les cannibales du Pacifique, pour périr
misérablement dans un train de chemin de fer ! Si cet homme énergique a
pu réfléchir pendant les dernières secondes de son existence, vous
figurez−vous quelles ont dû être ses suprêmes pensées ! »
En parlant ainsi, le capitaine Nemo semblait ému, et je porte cette émotion
à son actif.
Puis, la carte à la main, nous revîmes les travaux du navigateur français,
ses voyages de circumnavigation, sa double tentative au pôle Sud qui
amena la découverte des terres Adélie et Louis−Philippe, enfin ses levés
hydrographiques des principales îles de l’Océanie.
« Ce que votre d’Urville a fait à la surface des mers, me dit le capitaine
Nemo, je l’ai fait à l’intérieur de l’Océan, et plus facilement, plus
complètement que lui. L’Astrolabe et la Zélée, incessamment ballottées par
les ouragans, ne pouvaient valoir le Nautilus, tranquille cabinet de travail,
et véritablement sédentaire au milieu des eaux !
— Cependant, capitaine, dis−je, il y a un point de ressemblance entre les
corvettes de Dumont d’Urville et le Nautilus.
— Lequel, monsieur ?
— C’est que le Nautilus s’est échoué comme elles !
— Le Nautilus ne s’est pas échoué, monsieur, me répondit froidement le
capitaine Nemo. Le Nautilus est fait pour reposer sur le lit des mers, et les
pénibles travaux, les manoeuvres qu’imposa à d’Urville le renflouage de
ses corvettes, je ne les entreprendrai pas. L’Astrolabe et la Zélée ont failli
périr, mais mon Nautilus ne court aucun danger. Demain, au jour dit, à
l’heure dite, la marée le soulèvera paisiblement, et il reprendra sa
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 211
navigation à travers les mers.
— Capitaine, dis−je, je ne doute pas...
— Demain, ajouta le capitaine Nemo en se levant, demain, à deux heures
quarante minutes du soir, le Nautilus flottera et quittera sans avarie le
détroit de Torrès. »
Ces paroles prononcées d’un ton très bref, le capitaine Nemo s’inclina
légèrement. C’était me donner congé, et je rentrai dans ma chambre.
Là, je trouvai Conseil, qui désirait connaître le résultat de mon entrevue
avec le capitaine.
« Mon garçon, répondis−je, lorsque j’ai eu l’air de croire que son Nautilus
était menace par les naturels de la Papouasie, le capitaine m’a répondu très
ironiquement. Je n’ai donc qu’une chose à dire : Aie confiance en lui, et va
dormir en paix.
— Monsieur n’a pas besoin de mes services ?
— Non, mon ami. Que fait Ned Land ?
— Que monsieur m’excuse, répondit Conseil, mais l’ami Ned
confectionne un pâté de kangaroo qui sera une merveille ! »
Je restai seul, je me couchai, mais je dormis assez mal. J’entendais le bruit
des sauvages qui piétinaient sur la plate−forme en poussant des cris
assourdissants. La nuit se passa ainsi, et sans que l’équipage sortît de son
inertie habituelle. Il ne s’inquiétait pas plus de la présence de ces
cannibales que les soldats d’un fort blindé ne se préoccupent des fourmis
qui courent sur son blindage.
A six heures du matin, je me levai... Les panneaux n’avaient pas été
ouverts. L’air ne fut donc pas renouvelé à l’intérieur, mais les réservoirs,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 212
chargés à toute occurrence, fonctionnèrent à propos et lancèrent quelques
mètres cubes d’oxygène dans l’atmosphère appauvrie du Nautilus.
Je travaillai dans ma chambre jusqu’à midi, sans avoir vu, même un
instant, le capitaine Nemo. On ne paraissait faire à bord aucun préparatif
de départ.
J’attendis quelque temps encore, puis, je me rendis au grand salon. La
pendule marquait deux heures et demie. Dans dix minutes, le flot devait
avoir atteint son maximum de hauteur, et, si le capitaine Nemo n’avait
point fait une promesse téméraire, le Nautilus serait immédiatement
dégagé. Sinon, bien des mois se passeraient avant qu’il pût quitter son lit
de corail.
Cependant, quelques tressaillements avant−coureurs se firent bientôt sentir
dans la coque du bateau. J’entendis grincer sur son bordage les aspérités
calcaires du fond corallien.
A deux heures trente−cinq minutes, le capitaine Nemo parut dans le salon.
« Nous allons partir, dit−il.
— Ah ! fis−je.
— J’ai donné l’ordre d’ouvrir les panneaux.
— Et les Papouas ?
— Les Papouas ? répondit le capitaine Nemo, haussant légèrement les
épaules.
— Ne vont−ils pas pénétrer à l’intérieur du Nautilus ?
— Et comment ?
— En franchissant les panneaux que vous aurez fait ouvrir.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 213
— Monsieur Aronnax, répondit tranquillement le capitaine Nemo, on
n’entre pas ainsi par les panneaux du Nautilus, même quand ils sont
ouverts. »
Je regardai le capitaine.
« Vous ne comprenez pas ? me dit−il.
— Aucunement.
— Eh bien ! venez et vous verrez. »
Je me dirigeai vers l’escalier central. Là, Ned Land et Conseil, très
intrigués, regardaient quelques hommes de
l’équipage qui ouvraient les panneaux, tandis que des cris de rage et
d’épouvantables vociférations résonnaient au−dehors.
Les mantelets furent rabattus extérieurement. Vingt figures horribles
apparurent. Mais le premier de ces indigènes qui mit la main sur la rampe
de l’escalier, rejeté en arrière par je ne sais quelle force invisible, s’enfuit,
poussant des cris affreux et faisant des gambades exorbitantes.
Dix de ses compagnons lui succédèrent. Dix eurent le même sort.
Conseil était dans l’extase. Ned Land, emporté par ses instincts violents,
s’élança sur l’escalier. Mais, dès qu’il eut saisi la rampe à deux mains, il
fut renversé à son tour.
« Mille diables ! s’écria−t−il. Je suis foudroyé ! »
Ce mot m’expliqua tout. Ce n’était plus une rampe, mais un câble de
métal, tout chargé de l’électricité du bord, qui boutissait à la plate−forme.
Quiconque la touchait ressentait une formidable secousse, et cette secousse
eût été mortelle, si le capitaine Nemo eût lancé dans ce conducteur tout le
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 214
courant de ses appareils ! On peut réellement dire, qu’entre ses assaillants
et lui, il avait tendu un réseau électrique que nul ne pouvait impunément
franchir.
Cependant, les Papouas épouvantés avaient battu en retraite, affolés de
terreur. Nous, moitié riants, nous consolions et frictionnions le malheureux
Ned Land qui jurait comme un possédé.
Mais, en ce moment, le Nautilus, soulevé par les dernières ondulations du
flot, quitta son lit de corail à cette quarantième minute exactement fixée
par le capitaine. Son hélice battit les eaux avec une majestueuse lenteur. Sa
vitesse s’accrut peu à peu, et, naviguant à la surface de l’Océan, il
abandonna sain et sauf les dangereuses passes du détroit de Torrès.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La foudre du capitaine Nemo 215
Ægri somnia
Le jour suivant, 10 janvier, le Nautilus reprit sa marche entre deux eaux,
mais avec une vitesse remarquable que je ne puis estimer à moins de
trente−cinq milles à l’heure. La rapidité de son hélice était telle que je ne
pouvais ni suivre ses tours ni les compter.
Quand je songeais que ce merveilleux agent électrique, après avoir donné
le mouvement, la chaleur, la lumière au Nautilus, le protégeait encore
contre les attaques extérieures, et le transformait en une arche sainte à
laquelle nul profanateur ne touchait sans être foudroyé, mon admiration
n’avait plus de bornes, et de l’appareil, elle remontait aussitôt à l’ingénieur
qui l’avait créé.
Nous marchions directement vers l’ouest, et, le 11 janvier, nous doublâmes
ce cap Wessel, situé par 135° de longitude et l0° de latitude nord, qui
forme la pointe est du golfe de Carpentarie. Les récifs étaient encore
nombreux, mais plus clairsemés, et relevés sur la carte avec une extrême
précision. Le Nautilus évita facilement les brisants de Money à bâbord, et
les récifs Victoria à tribord, placés par 1300 de longitude, et sur ce dixième
parallèle que nous suivions rigoureusement.
Le 13 janvier, le capitaine Nemo. arrivé dans la mer de Timor, avait
connaissance de l’île de ce nom par 1220 de longitude. Cette île dont la
superficie est de seize cent vingt−cinq lieues carrées est gouvernée par des
radjahs. Ces princes se disent fils de crocodiles, c’est−à−dire issus de la
plus haute origine à laquelle un être humain puisse prétendre. Aussi, ces
ancêtres écailleux foisonnent dans les rivières de l’île, et sont l’objet d’une
vénération particulière. On les protège, on les gâte, on les adule, on les
nourrit, on leur offre des jeunes filles en pâture, et malheur à l’étranger qui
porte la main sur ces lézards sacrés.
Ægri somnia 216
Mais le Nautilus n’eut rien à démêler avec ces vilains animaux. Timor ne
fut visible qu’un instant, à midi, pendant que le second relevait sa position.
Également, je ne fis qu’entrevoir cette petite île Rotti, qui fait partie du
groupe, et dont les femmes ont une réputation de beauté très établie sur les
marchés malais.
A partir de ce point, la direction du Nautilus, en latitude, s’infléchit vers le
sud−ouest. Le cap fut mis sur l’océan Indien. Où la fantaisie du capitaine
Nemo allait−elle nous entraîner ? Remontrait−il vers les côtes de l’Asie ?
Se rapprocherait−il des rivages de l’Europe ? Résolutions peu probables de
la part d’un homme qui fuyait les continents habités ? Descendrait−il donc
vers le sud ? Irait−il doubler le cap de Bonne−Espérance, puis le cap Horn,
et pousser au pôle antarctique ? Reviendrait−il enfin vers ses mers du
Pacifique, où son Nautilus trouvait une navigation facile et indépendante ?
L’avenir devait nous l’apprendre.
Après avoir prolongé les écueils de Cartier, d’Hibernia, de Seringapatam,
de Scott, derniers efforts de l’élément solide contre l’élément liquide, le 14
janvier, nous étions au−delà de toutes terres. La vitesse du Nautilus fut
singulièrement ralentie, et, très capricieux dans ses allures, tantôt il nageait
au milieu des eaux, et tantôt il flottait à leur surface.
Pendant cette période du voyage, le capitaine Nemo fit d’intéressantes
expériences sur les diverses températures de la mer à des couches
différentes. Dans les conditions ordinaires, ces relevés s’obtiennent au
moyen d’instruments assez compliqués. dont les rapports sont au moins
douteux, que ce soient des sondes thermométriques, dont les verres se
brisent souvent sous la pression des eaux, ou des appareils basés sur la
variation de résistance de métaux aux courants électriques. Ces résultats
ainsi obtenus ne peuvent être suffisamment contrôlés. Au contraire, le
capitaine Nemo allait lui−même chercher cette température dans les
profondeurs de la mer, et son thermomètre, mis en communication avec les
diverses nappes liquides, lui donnait immédiatement et sûrement le degré
recherché.
C’est ainsi que, soit en surchargeant ses réservoirs, soit en descendant
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 217
obliquement au moyen de ses plans inclinés, le Nautilus atteignit
successivement des profondeurs de trois, quatre, cinq, sept, neuf et dix
mille mètres, et le résultat définitif de ces expériences fut que la mer
présentait une température permanente de quatre degrés et demi, à une
profondeur de mille mètres, sous toutes les latitudes.
Je suivais ces expériences avec le plus vif intérêt. Le capitaine Nemo y
apportait une véritable passion. Souvent, je me demandai dans quel but il
faisait ces observations. Était−ce au profit de ces semblables ? Ce n’était
pas probable, car, un jour ou l’autre, ses travaux devaient périr avec lui
dans quelque mer ignorée ! A moins qu’il ne me destinât le résultat de ses
expériences. Mais c’était admettre que mon étrange voyage aurait un
terme, et ce terme, je ne l’apercevais pas encore.
Quoi qu’il en soit, le capitaine Nemo me fit également connaître divers
chiffres obtenus par lui et qui établissaient le rapport des densités de l’eau
dans les principales mers du globe. De cette communication, je tirai un
enseignement personnel qui n’avait rien de scientifique.
C’était pendant la matinée du 15 janvier. Le capitaine, avec lequel je me
promenais sur la plate−forme, me demanda si je onnaissais les différentes
densités que présentent les eaux de la mer. Je lui répondis négativement, et
j’ajoutai que la science manquait d’observations rigoureuses à ce sujet.
« Je les ai faites, ces observations, me dit−il, et je puis en affirmer la
certitude.
— Bien, répondis−je, mais le Nautilus est un monde à part, et les secrets
de ses savants n’arrivent pas jusqu’à la terre.
— Vous avez raison, monsieur le professeur, me dit−il, après quelques
instants de silence. C’est un monde à part. Il est aussi étranger à la terre
que les planètes qui accompagnent ce globe autour du soleil, et l’on ne
connaîtra jamais les travaux des savants de Saturne ou de Jupiter.
Cependant, puisque le hasard a lié nos deux existences, je puis vous
communiquer le résultat de mes observations.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 218
— Je vous écoute, capitaine.
— Vous savez, monsieur le professeur, que l’eau de mer est plus dense que
l’eau douce, mais cette densité n’est pas uniforme. En effet, si je représente
par un la densité de l’eau douce, je trouve un vingt−huit millième pour les
eaux de l’Atlantique, un vingt−six millième pour les eaux du Pacifique, un
trente−millième pour les eaux de la Méditerranée...
— Ah ! pensai−je, il s’aventure dans la Méditerranée ?
— Un dix−huit millième pour les eaux de la mer Ionienne, et un
vingt−neuf millième pour les eaux de l’Adriatique. »
Décidément, le Nautilus ne fuyait pas les mers fréquentées de l’Europe, et
j’en conclus qu’il nous ramènerait – peut−être avant peu vers des
continents plus civilisés. Je pensai que Ned Land apprendrait cette
particularité avec une satisfaction très naturelle.
Pendant plusieurs jours, nos journées se passèrent en expériences de toutes
sortes, qui portèrent sur les degrés de salure des eaux à différentes
profondeurs, sur leur électrisation, sur leur coloration, sur leur
transparence, et dans toutes ces circonstances, le capitaine Nemo déploya
une ingéniosité qui ne fut égalée que par sa bonne grâce envers moi. Puis,
pendant quelques jours, je ne le revis plus, et demeurai de nouveau comme
isolé à son bord.
Le 16 janvier, le Nautilus parut s’endormir à quelques mètres seulement
au−dessous de la surface des flots. Ses appareils électriques ne
fonctionnaient pas, et son hélice immobile le laissait errer au gré des
courants. Je supposai que l’équipage s’occupait de réparations intérieures,
nécessitées par la violence des mouvements mécaniques de la machine.
Mes compagnons et moi, nous fûmes alors témoins d’un curieux spectacle.
Les panneaux du salon étaient ouverts, et comme le fanal du Nautilus
n’était pas en activité, une vague obscurité régnait au milieu des eaux.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 219
Le ciel orageux et couvert d’épais nuages ne donnait aux premières
couches de l’Océan qu’une insuffisante clarté.
J’observais l’état de la mer dans ces conditions, et les plus gros poissons ne
m’apparaissaient plus que comme des ombres à peine figurées, quand le
Nautilus se trouva subitement transporté en pleine lumière. Je crus d’abord
que le fanal avait été rallumé, et qu’il projetait son éclat électrique dans la
masse liquide. Je me trompais, et après une rapide observation, je reconnus
mon erreur.
Le Nautilus flottait au milieu d’une couche phosphorescente, qui dans cette
obscurité devenait éblouissante. Elle était produite par des myriades
d’animalcules lumineux, dont l’étincellement s’accroissait en glissant sur
la coque métallique de l’appareil. Je surprenais alors des éclairs au milieu
de ces nappes lumineuses, comme eussent été des coulées de plomb fondu
dans une fournaise ardente, ou des masses métalliques portées au rouge
blanc ; de telle sorte que par opposition, certaines portions lumineuses
faisaient ombre dans ce milieu igné, dont toute ombre semblait devoir être
bannie. Non ! ce n’était plus l’irradiation calme de notre éclairage
habituel ! Il y avait là une vigueur et un mouvement insolites ! Cette
lumière, on la sentait vivante !
En effet, c’était une agglomération infinie d’infusoires pélagiens, de
noctiluques miliaires, véritables globules de gelée diaphane, pourvus d’un
tentacule filiforme, et dont on a compté jusqu’à vingt−cinq mille dans
trente centimètres cubes d’eau. Et leur lumière était encore doublée par ces
lueurs particulières aux méduses, aux astéries, aux aurélies, aux
pholadesdattes, et autres zoophytes phosphorescents, imprégnés du
graissin des matières organiques décomposées par la mer, et peut−être du
mucus secrète par les poissons.
Pendant plusieurs heures, le Nautilus flotta dans ces ondes brillantes, et
notre admiration s’accrut à voir les gros animaux marins s’y jouer comme
des salamandres. Je vis là, au milieu de ce feu qui ne brûle pas, des
marsouins élégants et rapides, infatigables clowns des mers, et des
istiophores longs de trois mètres, intelligents précurseurs des ouragans,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 220
dont le formidable glaive heurtait parfois la vitre du salon. Puis apparurent
des poissons plus petits, des balistes variés, des scomberoïdes−sauteurs,
des nasons−loups, et cent autres qui zébraient dans leur course la
lumineuse atmosphère.
Ce fut un enchantement que cet éblouissant spectacle ! Peut−être quelque
condition atmosphérique augmentait−elle l’intensité de ce phénomène ?
Peut−être quelque orage se déchaînait−il à la surface des flots ? Mais, à
cette profondeur de quelques mètres, le Nautilus ne ressentait pas sa
fureur, et il se balançait paisiblement au milieu des eaux tranquilles.
Ainsi nous marchions, incessamment charmés par quelque merveille
nouvelle. Conseil observait et classait ses zoophytes, ses articulés, ses
mollusques, ses poissons. Les journées s’écoulaient rapidement, et je ne les
comptais plus. Ned, suivant son habitude, cherchait à varier l’ordinaire du
bord. Véritables colimaçons, nous étions faits à notre coquille, et j’affirme
qu’il est facile de devenir un parfait colimaçon.
Donc, cette existence nous paraissait facile, naturelle, et nous n’imaginions
plus qu’il existât une vie différente à la surface du globe terrestre, quand
un événement vint nous rappeler à l’étrangeté de notre situation.
Le 18 janvier, le Nautilus se trouvait par 105° de longitude et 15° de
latitude méridionale. Le temps était menaçant, la mer dure et houleuse. Le
vent soufflait de l’est en grande brise. Le baromètre, qui baissait depuis
quelques jours, annonçait une prochaine lutte des éléments.
J’étais monté sur la plate−forme au moment où le second prenait ses
mesures d’angles horaires. J’attendais, suivant la coutume, que la phrase
quotidienne fût prononcée. Mais, ce jour−là, elle fut remplacée par une
autre phrase non moins incompréhensible. Presque aussitôt, je vis
apparaître le capitaine Nemo, dont les yeux, munis d’une lunette, se
dirigèrent vers l’horizon.
Pendant quelques minutes, le capitaine resta immobile, sans quitter le point
enfermé dans le champ de son objectif. Puis, il abaissa sa lunette, et
échangea une dizaine de paroles avec son second. Celui−ci semblait être en
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 221
proie à une émotion qu’il voulait vainement contenir. Le capitaine Nemo,
plus maître de lui, demeurait froid.
Il paraissait, d’ailleurs, faire certaines objections auxquelles le second
répondait par des assurances formelles. Du moins, je le compris ainsi, à la
différence de leur ton et de leurs gestes.
Quant à moi, j’avais soigneusement regardé dans la direction observée,
sans rien apercevoir. Le ciel et l’eau se confondaient sur une ligne
d’horizon d’une parfaite netteté.
Cependant, le capitaine Nemo se promenait d’une extrémité à l’autre de la
plate−forme, sans me regarder, peut−être sans me voir. Son pas était
assuré, mais moins régulier que d’habitude. 11 s’arrêtait parfois, et les bras
croisés sur la poitrine, il observait la mer. Que pouvait−il chercher sur cet
immense espace ? Le Nautilus se trouvait alors à quelques centaines de
milles de la côte la plus rapprochée.
Le second avait repris sa lunette et interrogeait obstinément l’horizon,
allant et venant, frappant du pied. contrastant avec son chef par son
agitation nerveuse.
D’ailleurs, ce mystère allait nécessairement s’éclaircir, et avant peu, car,
sur un ordre du capitaine Nemo, la machine, accroissant sa puissance
propulsive, imprima à l’hélice une rotation plus rapide.
En ce moment, le second attira de nouveau l’attention du capitaine.
Celui−ci suspendit sa promenade et dirigea sa lunette vers le point indiqué.
Il l’observa longtemps. De mon côté, très sérieusement intrigué, je
descendis au salon, et j’en rapportai une excellente longue−vue dont je me
servais ordinairement. Puis, l’appuyant sur la cage du fanal qui formait
saillie à l’avant de la plate−forme, je me disposai à parcourir toute la ligne
du ciel et de la mer.
Mais, mon oeil ne s’était pas encore appliqué à l’oculaire, que l’instrument
me fut vivement arraché des mains.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 222
Je me retournai. Le capitaine Nemo était devant moi, mais je ne le
reconnus pas. Sa physionomie était transfigurée. Son oeil, brillant d’un feu
sombre, se dérobait sous son sourcil froncé. Ses dents se découvraient à
demi. Son corps raide, ses poings fermés, sa tête retirée entre les épaules,
témoignaient de la haine violente que respirait toute sa personne. Il ne
bougeait pas. Ma lunette tombée de sa main, avait roulé à ses pieds.
Venais−je donc, sans le vouloir, de provoquer cette attitude de colère ?
S’imaginait−il, cet incompréhensible personnage, que j’avais surpris
quelque secret interdit aux hôtes du Nautilus ?
Non ! cette haine, je n’en étais pas l’objet, car il ne me regardait pas, et son
oeil restait obstinément fixé sur l’impénétrable point de l’horizon.
Enfin, le capitaine Nemo redevint maître de lui. Sa physionomie, si
profondément altérée, reprit son calme habituel. Il adressa à son second
quelques mots en langue étrangère, puis il se retourna vers moi.
« Monsieur Aronnax, me dit−il d’un ton assez impérieux, je réclame de
vous l’observation de l’un des engagements qui vous lient à moi.
— De quoi s’agit−il, capitaine ?
— Il faut vous laisser enfermer, vos compagnons et vous, jusqu’au
moment où je jugerai convenable de vous rendre la liberté.
— Vous êtes le maître, lui répondis−je, en le regardant fixement. Mais
puis−je vous adresser une question ?
— Aucune, monsieur. »
Sur ce mot, je n’avais pas à discuter, mais à obéir, puisque toute résistance
eût été impossible.
Je descendis à la cabine qu’occupaient Ned Land et Conseil, et je leur fis
part de la détermination du capitaine. Je laisse à penser comment cette
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 223
communication fut reçue par le Canadien. D’ailleurs, le temps manqua à
toute explication. Quatre hommes de l’équipage attendaient à la porte, et
ils nous conduisirent à cette cellule où nous avions passé notre première
nuit à bord du Nautilus.
Ned Land voulut réclamer, mais la porte se ferma sur lui pour toute
réponse.
« Monsieur me dira−t−il ce que cela signifie ? » me demanda Conseil.
Je racontai à mes compagnons ce qui s’était passé. Ils furent aussi étonnés
que moi, mais aussi peu avancés.
Cependant, j’étais plongé dans un abîme de réflexions, et l’étrange
appréhension de la physionomie du capitaine Nemo ne quittait pas ma
pensée. J’étais incapable d’accoupler deux idées logiques, et je me perdais
dans les plus absurdes hypothèses, quand je fus tiré de ma contention
d’esprit par ces paroles de Ned Land :
« Tiens ! le déjeuner est servi ! »
En effet, la table était préparée. Il était évident que le capitaine Nemo avait
donné cet ordre en même temps qu’il faisait hâter la marche du Nautilus.
« Monsieur me permettra−t−il de lui faire une recommandation ? me
demanda Conseil.
— Oui, mon garçon, répondis−je.
— Eh bien ! que monsieur déjeune. C’est prudent, car nous ne savons ce
qui peut arriver.
— Tu as raison, Conseil.
— Malheureusement, dit Ned Land, on ne nous a donné que le menu du
bord.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 224
— Ami Ned, répliqua Conseil, que diriez−vous donc, si le déjeuner avait
manqué totalement ! »
Cette raison coupa net aux récriminations du harponneur.
Nous nous mîmes à table. Le repas se fit assez silencieusement. Je mangeai
peu. Conseil « se força », toujours par prudence, et Ned Land, quoi qu’il en
eût, ne perdit pas un coup de dent. Puis, le déjeuner terminé, chacun de
nous s’accota dans son coin.
En ce moment, le globe lumineux qui éclairait la cellule s’éteignit et nous
laissa dans une obscurité profonde. Ned Land ne tarda pas à s’endormir, et,
ce qui m’étonna, Conseil se laissa aller aussi à un lourd assoupissement. Je
me demandais ce qui avait pu provoquer chez lui cet impérieux besoin de
sommeil, quand je sentis mon cerveau s’imprégner d’une épaisse torpeur.
Mes yeux, que je voulais tenir ouverts, se fermèrent malgré moi. J’étais en
proie à une hallucination douloureuse. Évidemment, des substances
soporifiques avaient été mêlées aux aliments que nous venions de prendre !
Ce n’était donc pas assez de la prison pour nous dérober les projets du
capitaine Nemo, il fallait encore le sommeil !
J’entendis alors les panneaux se refermer. Les ondulations de la mer qui
provoquaient un léger mouvement de roulis, cessèrent. Le Nautilus avait−il
donc quitté la surface de l’Océan ? Était−il rentré dans la couche immobile
des eaux ?
Je voulus résister au sommeil. Ce fut impossible. Ma respiration s’affaiblit.
Je sentis un froid mortel glacer mes membres alourdis et comme paralysés.
Mes paupières, véritables calottes de plomb, tombèrent sur mes yeux. Je ne
pus les soulever. Un sommeil morbide, plein d’hallucinations, s’empara de
tout mon être. Puis, les visions disparurent, et me laissèrent dans un
complet anéantissement.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Ægri somnia 225
Le royaume du corail
Le lendemain, je me réveillai la tête singulièrement dégagée. A ma grande
surprise, j’étais dans ma chambre. Mes compagnons. sans doute, avaient
été réintégrés dans leur cabine, sans qu’ils s’en fussent aperçus plus que
moi. Ce qui s’était passé pendant cette nuit, ils l’ignoraient comme je
l’ignorais moi−même, et pour dévoiler ce mystère, je ne comptais que sur
les hasards de l’avenir.
Je songeai alors à quitter ma chambre. Étais−je encore une fois libre ou
prisonnier ? Libre entièrement. J’ouvris la porte, je pris par les coursives,
je montai l’escalier central. Les panneaux, fermés la veille, étaient ouverts.
J’arrivai sur la plate−forme.
Ned Land et Conseil m’y attendaient. Je les interrogeai. Ils ne savaient
rien. Endormis d’un sommeil pesant qui ne leur laissait aucun souvenir, ils
avaient été très surpris de se retrouver dans leur cabine.
Quant au Nautilus, il nous parut tranquille et mystérieux comme toujours.
Il flottait à la surface des flots sous une allure modérée. Rien ne semblait
changé à bord.
Ned Land, de ses yeux pénétrants, observa la mer. Elle était déserte. Le
Canadien ne signala rien de nouveau à l’horizon, ni voile, ni terre. Une
brise d’ouest soufflait bruyamment, et de longues lames, échevelées par le
vent, imprimaient à l’appareil un très sensible roulis.
Le Nautilus, après avoir renouvelé son air, se maintint à une profondeur
moyenne de quinze mètres, de manière à pouvoir revenir promptement à la
surface des flots. Opération qui, contre l’habitude, fut pratiquée plusieurs
fois, pendant cette journée du 19 janvier. Le second montait alors sur la
plate−forme, et la phrase accoutumée retentissait à l’intérieur du navire.
Le royaume du corail 226
Quant au capitaine Nemo, il ne parut pas. Des gens du bord, je ne vis que
l’impassible stewart, qui me servit avec son exactitude et son mutisme
ordinaires.
Vers deux heures, j’étais au salon. occupé à classer mes notes, lorsque le
capitaine ouvrit la porte et parut. Je le saluai. Il me rendit un salut presque
imperceptible, sans m’adresser la parole. Je me remis à mon travail,
espérant qu’il me donnerait peut−être des explications sur les événements
qui avaient marqué la nuit précédente. Il n’en fit rien. Je le regardai. Sa
figure me parut fatiguée ; ses yeux rougis n’avaient pas été rafraîchis par le
sommeil ; sa physionomie exprimait une tristesse profonde, un réel
chagrin. Il allait et venait, s’asseyait et se relevait, prenait un livre au
hasard, l’abandonnait aussitôt. consultait ses instruments sans prendre ses
notes habituelles, et semblait ne pouvoir tenir un instant en place.
Enfin, il vint vers moi et me dit :
« Etes−vous médecin, monsieur Aronnax ? »
Je m’attendais si peu à cette demande, que je le regardai quelque temps
sans répondre.
« Etes−vous médecin ? répéta−t−il. Plusieurs de vos collègues ont fait
leurs études de médecine, Gratiolet, Moquin−Tandon et autres.
— En effet, dis−je, je suis docteur et interne des hôpitaux. J’ai pratiqué
pendant plusieurs années avant d’entrer au Muséum.
— Bien, monsieur. »
Ma réponse avait évidemment satisfait le capitaine Nemo. Mais ne sachant
où il en voulait venir, j’attendis de nouvelles questions, me réservant de
répondre suivant les circonstances.
« Monsieur Aronnax, me dit le capitaine, consentiriez−vous à donner vos
soins à l’un de mes hommes ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 227
— Vous avez un malade ?
— Oui.
— Je suis prêt à vous suivre.
— Venez. »
J’avouerai que mon coeur battait. Je ne sais pourquoi je voyais une
certaine connexité entre cette maladie d’un homme de l’équipage et les
événements de la veille, et ce mystère me préoccupait au moins autant que
le malade.
Le capitaine Nemo me conduisit à l’arrière du Nautilus, et me fit entrer
dans une cabine située près du poste des matelots.
Là, sur un lit, reposait un homme d’une quarantaine d’années, à figure
énergique, vrai type de l’Anglo−Saxon.
Je me penchai sur lui. Ce n’était pas seulement un malade, c’était un
blessé. Sa tête, emmaillotée de linges sanglants, reposait sur un double
oreiller. Je détachai ces linges, et le blessé, regardant de ses grands yeux
fixes, me laissa faire, sans proférer une seule plainte.
La blessure était horrible. Le crâne, fracassé par un instrument contondant,
montrait la cervelle à nu, et la substance cérébrale avait subi une attrition
profonde. Des caillots sanguins s’étaient formés dans la masse diffluente,
qui affectait une couleur lie de vin. Il y avait eu à la fois contusion et
commotion du cerveau. La respiration du malade était lente, et quelques
mouvements spasmodiques des muscles agitaient sa face. La phlegmasie
cérébrale était complète et entraînait la paralysie du sentiment et du
mouvement.
Je pris le pouls du blessé. Il était intermittent. Les extrémités du corps se
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 228
refroidissaient déjà, et je vis que la mort s’approchait, sans qu’il me parût
possible de l’enrayer. Après avoir pansé ce malheureux, je rajustai les
linges de sa tête, et je me retournai vers le capitaine Nemo.
« D’où vient cette blessure ? Lui demandai−je.
— Qu’importe ! répondit évasivement le capitaine. Un choc du Nautilus a
brisé un des leviers de la machine, qui a frappé cet homme. Mais votre avis
sur son état ? »
J’hésitais à me prononcer.
« Vous pouvez parler, me dit le capitaine. Cet homme n’entend pas le
français. »
Je regardai une dernière fois le blessé, puis je répondis :
« Cet homme sera mort dans deux heures.
— Rien ne peut le sauver ?
— Rien. »
La main du capitaine Nemo se crispa, et quelques larmes glissèrent de ses
yeux, que je ne croyais pas faits pour pleurer.
Pendant quelques instants, j’observai encore ce mourant dont la vie se
retirait peu à peu. Sa pâleur s’accroissait encore sous l’éclat électrique qui
baignait son lit de mort. Je regardais sa tête intelligente. sillonnée de rides
prématurées, que le malheur, la misère peut−être. avaient creusées depuis
longtemps. Je cherchais à surprendre le secret de sa vie dans les dernières
paroles échappées à ses lèvres !
« Vous pouvez vous retirer, monsieur Aronnax », me dit le capitaine
Nemo.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 229
Je laissai le capitaine dans la cabine du mourant, et je regagnai ma
chambre. très ému de cette scène. Pendant toute la journée, je fus agité de
sinistres pressentiments. La nuit, je dormis mal, et, entre mes songes
fréquemment interrompus, je crus entendre des soupirs lointains et comme
une psalmodie funèbre. Était−ce la prière des morts, murmurée dans cette
langue que je ne savais comprendre ?
Le lendemain matin, je montai sur le pont. Le capitaine Nemo m’y avait
précédé. Dès qu’il m’aperçut. il vint à moi.
« Monsieur le professeur, me dit−il, vous conviendrait−il de faire
aujourd’hui une excursion sous−marine ?
— Avec mes compagnons ? demandai−je.
— Si cela leur plaît.
— Nous sommes à vos ordres, capitaine.
— Veuillez donc aller revêtir vos scaphandres. »
Du mourant ou du mort il ne fut pas question. Je rejoignis,Ned Land et
Conseil. Je leur fis connaître la proposition du capitaine Nemo. Conseil
s’empressa d’accepter, et, cette fois, le Canadien se montra très disposé à
nous suivre.
Il était huit heures du matin. A huit heures et demie, nous étions vêtus pour
cette nouvelle promenade, et munis des deux appareils d’éclairage et de
respiration. La double porte fut ouverte, et, accompagnés du capitaine
Nemo que suivaient une douzaine d’hommes de l’équipage, nous prenions
pied à une profondeur de dix mètres sur le sol ferme où reposait le
Nautilus.
Une légère pente aboutissait à un fond accidenté. par quinze brasses de
profondeur environ. Ce fond différait complètement de celui que j’avais
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 230
visité pendant ma première excursion sous les eaux de l’Océan Pacifique.
Ici, point de sable fin, point de prairies sous−marines, nulle forêt
pélagienne. Je reconnus immédiatement cette région merveilleuse dont, ce
jour−là, le capitaine Nemo nous faisait les honneurs. C’était le royaume du
corail.
Dans l’embranchement des zoophytes et dans la classe des alcyonnaires,
on remarque l’ordre des gorgonaires qui renferme les trois groupes des
gorgoniens, des isidiens et des coralliens. C’est à ce dernier qu’appartient
le corail, curieuse substance qui fut tour à tour classée dans les règnes
minéral, végétal et animal. Remède chez les anciens, bijou chez les
modernes, ce fut seulement en 1694 que le Marseillais Peysonnel le rangea
définitivement dans le règne animal.
Le corail est un ensemble d’animalcules, réunis sur un polypier de nature
cassante et pierreuse. Ces polypes ont un générateur unique qui les a
produits par bourgeonnement, et ils possèdent une existence propre, tout en
participant à la vie commune. C’est donc une sorte de socialisme naturel.
Je connaissais les derniers travaux faits sur ce bizarre zoophyte, qui se
minéralise tout en s’arborisant, suivant la très juste observation des
naturalistes, et rien ne pouvait être plus intéressant pour moi que de visiter
l’une de ces forêts pétrifiées que la nature a plantées au fond des mers.
Les appareils Rumhkorff furent mis en activité, et nous suivîmes un banc
de corail en voie de formation, qui, le temps aidant, fermera un jour cette
portion de l’océan indien. La route était bordée d’inextricables buissons
formés par l’enchevêtrement d’arbrisseaux que couvraient de petites fleurs
étoilées à rayons blancs. Seulement, à l’inverse des plantes de la terre, ces
arborisations, fixées aux rochers du sol, se dirigeaient toutes de haut en
bas.
La lumière produisait mille effets charmants en se jouant au milieu de ces
ramures si vivement colorées. Il me semblait voir ces tubes membraneux et
cylindriques trembler sous l’ondulation des eaux. J’étais tenté de cueillir
leurs fraîches corolles ornées de délicats tentacules, les unes nouvellement
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 231
épanouies, les autres naissant à peine, pendant que de légers poissons, aux
rapides nageoires, les effleuraient en passant comme des volées d’oiseaux.
Mais, si ma main s’approchait de ces fleurs vivantes, de ces sensitives
animées, aussitôt l’alerte se mettait dans la colonie. Les corolles blanches
rentraient dans leurs étuis rouges, les fleurs s’évanouissaient sous mes
regards, et le buisson se changeait en un bloc de mamelons pierreux.
Le hasard m’avait mis là en présence des plus précieux échantillons de ce
zoophyte. Ce corail valait celui qui se pêche dans la Méditerranée, sur les
côtes de France, d’Italie et de Barbarie. Il justifiait par ses tons vifs ces
noms poétiques de fleur de sang et d’écume de sang que le commerce
donne à ses plus beaux produits. Le corail se vend jusqu’à cinq cents
francs le kilogramme, et en cet endroit, les couches liquides recouvraient la
fortune de tout un monde de corailleurs. Cette précieuse matière, souvent
mélangée avec d’autres polypiers, formait alors des ensembles compacts et
inextricables appelés « macciota », et sur lesquels je remarquai
d’admirables spécimens de corail rose.
Mais bientôt les buissons se resserrèrent, les arborisations grandirent. De
véritables taillis pétrifiés et de longues travées d’une architecture
fantaisiste s’ouvrirent devant nos pas. Le capitaine Nemo s’engagea sous
une obscure galerie dont la pente douce nous conduisit à une profondeur de
cent mètres. La lumière de nos serpentins produisait parfois des effets
magiques, en s’accrochant aux rugueuses aspérités de ces arceaux naturels
et aux pendentifs disposés comme des lustres, qu’elle piquait de pointes de
feu. Entre les arbrisseaux coralliens, j’observai d’autres polypes non moins
curieux, des mélites, des iris aux ramifications articulées, puis quelques
touffes de corallines, les unes vertes, les autres rouges, véritables algues
encroûtées dans leurs sels calcaires, que lesnaturalistes, après longues
discussions, ont définitivement rangées dans le règne végétal. Mais,
suivant la remarque d’un penseur, « c’est peut−être là le point réel où la
vie obscurément se soulève du sommeil de pierre, sans se détacher encore
de ce rude point de départ ».
Enfin, après deux heures de marche, nous avions atteint une profondeur de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 232
trois cents mètres environ, c’est−à−dire la limite extrême sur laquelle le
corail commence à se former. Mais là, ce n’était plus le buisson isolé, ni le
modeste taillis de basse futaie. C’était la forêt immense, les grandes
végétations minérales, les énormes arbres pétrifiés, réunis par des
guirlandes d’élégantes plumarias, ces lianes de la mer, toutes parées de
nuances et de reflets. Nous passions librement sous leur haute ramure
perdue dans l’ombre des flots, tandis qu’à nos pieds, les tubipores, les
méandrines, les astrées, les fongies, les cariophylles, formaient un tapis de
fleurs, semé de gemmes éblouissantes.
Quel indescriptible spectacle ! Ah ! que ne pouvions−nous communiquer
nos sensations ! Pourquoi étions−nous emprisonnés sous ce masque de
métal et de verre ! Pourquoi les paroles nous étaient−elles interdites de l’un
à l’autre ! Que ne vivions−nous, du moins, de la vie de ces poissons qui
peuplent le liquide élément, ou plutôt encore de celle de ces amphibies qui,
pendant de longues heures, peuvent parcourir, au gré de leur caprice, le
double domaine de la terre et des eaux !
Cependant, le capitaine Nemo s’était arrêté. Mes compagnons et mol nous
suspendîmes notre marche, et, me retournant, je vis que ses hommes
formaient un demi−cercle autour de leur chef. En regardant avec plus
d’attention, j’observai que quatre d’entre eux portaient sur leurs épaules un
objet de forme oblongue.
Nous occupions, en cet endroit. Le centre d’une vaste clairière, entourée
par les hautes arborisations de la forêt sous−marine. Nos lampes
projetaient sur cet espace une sorte de clarté crépusculaire qui allongeait
démesurément les ombres sur le sol. A la limite de la clairière, l’obscurité
redevenait profonde, et ne recueillait que de petites étincelles retenues par
les vives arêtes du corail.
Ned Land et Conseil étaient près de moi. Nous regardions, et il me vint à la
pensée que j’allais assister a une scène étrange. En observant le sol, je vis
qu’il était gonflé, en de certains points, par de légères extumescences
encroûtées de dépôts calcaires, et disposées avec une régularité qui
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 233
trahissait la main de l’homme.
Au milieu de la clairière, sur un piédestal de rocs grossièrement entassés,
se dressait une croix de corail, qui étendait ses longs bras qu’on eût dit
faits d’un sang pétrifié.
Sur un signe du capitaine Nemo, un de ses hommes s’avança, et à quelques
pieds de la croix, il commença à creuser un trou avec une pioche qu’il
détacha de sa ceinture.
Je compris tout ! Cette clairière c’était un cimetière, ce trou, une tombe, cet
objet oblong, le corps de l’homme mort dans la nuit ! Le capitaine Nemo et
les siens venaient enterrer leur compagnon dans cette demeure commune,
au fond de cet inaccessible Océan !
Non ! jamais mon esprit ne fut surexcité à ce point ! Jamais idées plus
impressionnantes n’envahirent mon cerceau ! Je ne voulais pas voir ce que
voyait mes yeux !
Cependant, la tombe se creusait lentement. Les poissons fuyaient çà et là
leur retraite troublée. J’entendais résonner, sur le sol calcaire, le fer du pic
qui étincelait parfois en heurtant quelque silex perdu au fond des eaux. Le
trou s’allongeait, s’élargissait, et bientôt il fut assez profond pour recevoir
le corps.
Alors, les porteurs s’approchèrent. Le corps, enveloppé dans un tissu de
byssus blanc, descendit dans sa humide tombe. Le capitaine Nemo, les bras
croisés sur la poitrine, et tous les amis de celui qui les avait aimés
s’agenouillèrent dans l’attitude de la prière... Mes deux compagnons et
moi, nous nous étions religieusement inclinés.
La tombe fut alors recouverte des débris arrachés au sol, qui formèrent un
léger renflement.
Quand ce fut fait, le capitaine Nemo et ses hommes se redressèrent ; puis,
se rapprochant de la tombe, tous fléchirent encore le genou, et tous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le royaume du corail 234
étendirent leur main en signe de suprême adieu...
Alors, la funèbre troupe reprit le chemin du Nautilus, repassant sous les
arceaux de la forêt, au milieu des taillis, le long des buissons de corail, et
toujours montant.
Enfin, les feux du bord apparurent. Leur traînée lumineuse nous guida
jusqu’au Nautilus. A une heure, nous étions de retour.
Dès que mes vêtements furent changés, je remontai sur la plate−forme, et,
en proie à une terrible obsession d’idées, j’allai m’asseoir près du fanal.
Le capitaine Nemo me rejoignit. Je me levai et lui dis :
« Ainsi, suivant mes prévisions, cet homme est mort dans la nuit ?
— Oui, monsieur Aronnax, répondit le capitaine Nemo.
— Et il repose maintenant près de ses compagnons, dans ce cimetière de
corail ?
— Oui, oubliés de tous, mais non de nous ! Nous creusons la tombe, et les
polypes se chargent d’y sceller nos morts pour l’éternité ! »
Et cachant d’un geste brusque son visage dans ses mains crispées, le
capitaine essaya vainement de comprimer un sanglot. Puis il ajouta :
« C’est là notre paisible cimetière, à quelques centaines de pieds
au−dessous de la surface des flots !
— Vos morts y dorment, du moins, tranquilles, capitaine, hors de l’atteinte
des requins !
— Oui, monsieur, répondit gravement le capitaine Nemo, des requins et
des hommes ! »

Le royaume du corail 235
Deuxième partie
Deuxième partie 236
L'océan indien
Ici commence la seconde partie de ce voyage sous les mers. La première
s’est terminée sur cette émouvante scène du cimetière de corail qui a laissé
dans mon esprit une impression profonde. Ainsi donc, au sein de cette mer
immense, la vie du capitaine Nemo se déroulait tout entière, et il n’était
pas jusqu’à sa tombe qu’il n’eût préparée dans le plus impénétrable de ses
abîmes. Là, pas un des monstres de l’Océan ne viendrait troubler le dernier
sommeil de ces hôtes du Nautilus, de ces amis, rivés les uns aux autres,
dans la mort aussi bien que dans la vie ! « Nul homme, non plus ! » avait
ajouté le capitaine.
Toujours cette même défiance, farouche, implacable, envers les sociétés
humaines !
Pour moi, je ne me contentais plus des hypothèses qui satisfaisaient
Conseil. Ce digne garçon persistait à ne voir dans le commandant du
Nautilus qu’un de ces savants méconnus qui rendent à l’humanité mépris
pour indifférence. C’était encore pour lui un génie incompris qui, las des
déceptions de la terre, avait dû se réfugier dans cet inaccessible milieu où
ses instincts s’exerçaient librement. Mais, à mon avis, cette hypothèse
n’expliquait qu’un des cotes du capitaine Nemo.
En effet, le mystère de cette dernière nuit pendant laquelle nous avions été
enchaînés dans la prison et le sommeil, la précaution si violemment prise
par le capitaine d’arracher de mes yeux la lunette prête à parcourir
l’horizon, la blessure mortelle de cet homme due à un choc inexplicable du
Nautilus, tout cela me poussait dans une voie nouvelle. Non ! le capitaine
Nemo ne se contentait pas de fuir les hommes ! Son formidable appareil
servait non seulement ses instincts de liberté, mais peut−être aussi les
intérêts de je ne sais quelles terribles représailles.
En ce moment, rien n’est évident pour moi, je n’entrevois encore dans ces
L'océan indien 237
ténèbres que des lueurs, et je dois me borner à écrire, pour ainsi dire, sous
la dictée des événements.
D’ailleurs rien ne nous lie au capitaine Nemo. Il sait que s’échapper du
Nautilus est impossible. Nous ne sommes pas même prisonniers sur parole.
Aucun engagement d’honneur ne nous enchaîne. Nous ne sommes que des
captifs, que des prisonniers déguisés sous le nom d’hôtes par un semblant
de courtoisie. Toutefois, Ned Land n’a pas renoncé à l’espoir de recouvrer
sa liberté. Il est certain qu’il profitera de la première occasion que le hasard
lui offrira. Je ferai comme lui sans doute. Et cependant, ce ne sera pas sans
une sorte de regret que j’emporterai ce que la générosité du capitaine nous
aura laissé pénétrer des mystères du Nautilus ! Car enfin, faut−il haïr cet
homme ou l’admirer ? Est−ce une victime ou un bourreau ? Et puis, pour
être franc, je voudrais. avant de l’abandonner à jamais, je voudrais avoir
accompli ce tour du monde sous−marin dont les débuts sont si
magnifiques. Je voudrais avoir observé la complète série des merveilles
entassées sous les mers du globe. Je voudrais avoir vu ce que nul homme
n’a vu encore, quand je devrais payer de ma vie cet insatiable besoin
d’apprendre ! Qu’ai−je découvert jusqu’ici ? Rien, ou presque rien,
puisque nous n’avons encore parcouru que six mille lieues à travers le
Pacifique !
Pourtant je sais bien que le Nautilus se rapproche des terres habitées, et
que, si quelque chance de salut s’offre à nous, il serait cruel de sacrifier
mes compagnons à ma passion pour l’inconnu. Il faudra les suivre,
peut−être même les guider. Mais cette occasion se présentera−t−elle
jamais ? L’homme privé par la force de son libre arbitre la désire, cette
occasion, mais le savant, le curieux, la redoute.
Ce jour−là, 21 janvier 1868, à midi, le second vint prendre la hauteur du
soleil. Je montai sur la plate−forme, j’allumai un cigare, et je suivis
l’opération. Il me parut évident que cet homme ne comprenait pas le
français, car plusieurs fois je fis à voix haute des réflexions qui auraient dû
lui arracher quelque signe involontaire d’attention, s’il les eût comprises,
mais il resta impassible et muet.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 238
Pendant qu’il observait au moyen du sextant. un des matelots du Nautilus
cet homme vigoureux qui nous avait accompagnés lors de notre première
excursion sous−marine à l’île Crespo vint nettoyer les vitres du fanal.
J’examinai alors l’installation de cet appareil dont la puissance était
centuplée par des anneaux lenticulaires disposés comme ceux des phares,
et qui maintenaient sa lumière dans le plan utile. La lampe électrique était
combinée de manière à donner tout son pouvoir éclairant. Sa lumière, en
effet, se produisait dans le vide, ce qui assurait à la fois sa régularité et son
intensité. Ce vide économisait aussi les pointes de graphite entre lesquelles
se développe l’arc lumineux. Économie importante pour le capitaine
Nemo, qui n’aurait pu les renouveler aisément. Mais, dans ces conditions,
leur usure était presque insensible.
Lorsque le Nautilus se prépara à reprendre sa marche sous−marine, je
redescendis au salon. Les panneaux se refermèrent, et la route fut donnée
directement à l’ouest.
Nous sillonnions alors les flots de l’océan Indien, vaste plaine liquide
d’une contenance de cinq cent cinquante millions d’hectares, et dont les
eaux sont si transparentes qu’elles donnent le vertige à qui se penche à leur
surface. Le Nautilus y flottait généralement entre cent et deux cents mètres
de profondeur. Ce fut ainsi pendant quelques jours. A tout autre que moi,
pris d’un immense amour de la mer, les heures eussent sans doute paru
longues et monotones ; mais ces promenades quotidiennes sur la
plate−forme où je me retrempais dans l’air vivifiant de l’Océan, le
spectacle de ces riches eaux à travers les vitres du salon, la lecture des
livres de la bibliothèque, la rédaction de mes mémoires, employaient tout
mon temps et ne me laissaient pas un moment de lassitude ou d’ennui.
Notre santé à tous se maintenait dans un état très satisfaisant. Le régime du
bord nous convenait parfaitement, et pour mon compte, je me serais bien
passé des variantes que Ned Land, par esprit de protestation, s’ingéniait à y
apporter. De plus, dans cette température constante, il n’y avait pas même
un rhume à craindre. D’ailleurs, ce madréporaire Dendrophyllée, connu en
Provence sous le nom de « Fenouil de mer », et dont il existait une certaine
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 239
réserve à bord, eût fourni avec la chair fondante de ses polypes une pâte
excellente contre la toux.
Pendant quelques jours, nous vîmes une grande quantité d’oiseaux
aquatiques, palmipèdes, mouettes ou goélands. Quelques−uns furent
adroitement tués, et, préparés d’une certaine façon, ils fournirent un gibier
d’eau très acceptable. Parmi les grands voiliers, emportés à de longues
distances de toutes terres, et qui se reposent sur les flots des fatigues du
vol, j’aperçus de magnifiques albatros au cri discordant comme un
braiement d’âne, oiseaux qui appartiennent à la famille des longipennes.
La famille des totipalmes était représentée par des frégates rapides qui
pêchaient prestement les poissons de la surface, et par de nombreux
phaétons ou paille−en−queue, entre autres, ce phaéton à brins rouges, gros
comme un pigeon, et dont le plumage blanc est nuancé de tons roses qui
font valoir la teinte noire des ailes.
Les filets du Nautilus rapportèrent plusieurs sortes de tortues marines, du
genre caret, à dos bombé, et dont l’écaille est très estimée. Ces reptiles, qui
plongent facilement, peuvent se maintenir longtemps sous l’eau en fermant
la soupape charnue située à l’orifice externe de leur canal nasal.
Quelques−uns de ces carets, lorsqu’on les prit, dormaient encore dans leur
carapace, à l’abri des animaux marins. La chair de ces tortues était
généralement médiocre, mais leurs oeufs formaient un régal excellent.
Quant aux poissons, ils provoquaient toujours notre admiration, quand
nous surprenions à travers les panneaux ouverts les secrets de leur vie
aquatique. Je remarquai plusieurs espèces qu’il ne m’avait pas été donné
d’observer jusqu’alors.
Je citerai principalement des ostracions particuliers à la mer Rouge, à la
mer des Indes et à cette partie de l’Océan qui baigne les côtes de
l’Amérique équinoxiale. Ces poissons, comme les tortues, les tatous, les
oursins, les crustacés, sont protégés par une cuirasse qui n’est ni crétacée,
ni pierreuse, mais véritablement osseuse. Tantôt, elle affecte la forme d’un
solide triangulaire, tantôt la forme d’un solide quadrangulaire. Parmi les
triangulaires, j’en notai quelques−uns d’une longueur d’un
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 240
demi−décimètre, d’une chair salubre, d’un goût exquis, bruns à la queue,
jaunes aux nageoires, et dont je recommande l’acclimatation même dans
les eaux douces, auxquelles d’ailleurs un certain nombre de poissons de
mer s’accoutument aisément. Je citerai aussi des ostracions
quadrangulaires, surmontés sur le dos de quatre gros tubercules : des
ostracions mouchetés de points blancs sous la partie inférieure du corps,
qui s’apprivoisent comme des oiseaux ; des trigones, pourvus d’aiguillons
formés par la prolongation de leur croûte osseuse, et auxquels leur
singulier grognement a valu le surnom de « cochons de mer » ; puis des
dromadaires à grosses bosses en forme de cône, dont la chair est dure et
coriace.
Je relève encore sur les notes quotidiennes tenues par maître Conseil
certains poissons du genre tétrodons, particuliers à ces mers, des
spenglériens au dos rouge, à la poitrine blanche, qui se distinguent par trois
rangées longitudinales de filaments, et des électriques, longs de sept
pouces, parés des plus vives couleurs. Puis, comme échantillons d’autres
genres, des ovoïdes semblables à un oeuf d’un brun noir, sillonnés de
bandelettes blanches et dépourvus de queue ; des diodons. véritables
porcs−épics de la mer, munis d’aiguillons et pouvant se gonfler de manière
à former une pelote hérissée de dards ; des hippocampes communs à tous
les océans ; des pégases volants, à museau allongé, auxquels leurs
nageoires pectorales, très étendues et disposées en forme d’ailes,
permettent sinon de voler, du moins de s’élancer dans les airs ; des pigeons
spatulés, dont la queue est couverte de nombreux anneaux écailleux ; des
macrognathes à longue mâchoire, excellents poissons longs de vingt−cinq
centimètres et brillants des plus agréables couleurs ; des calliomores
livides, dont la tête est rugueuse ; des myriades de blennies−sauteurs, rayés
de noir, aux longues nageoires pectorales, glissant à la surface des eaux
avec une prodigieuse vélocité ; de délicieux vélifères, qui peuvent hisser
leurs nageoires comme autant de voiles déployées aux courants
favorables ; des kurtes splendides, auxquels la nature a prodigué le jaune,
le bleu céleste, l’argent et l’or ; des trichoptères, dont les ailes sont formées
de filaments ; des cottes, toujours maculées de limon, qui produisent un
certain bruissement ; des trygles, dont le foie est considéré comme poison ;
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 241
des bodians, qui portent sur les yeux une oeillère mobile ; enfin des
soufflets, au museau long et tubuleux, véritables gobe−mouches de
l’Océan, armés d’un fusil que n’ont prévu ni les Chassepot ni les
Remington, et qui tuent les insectes en les frappant d’une simple goutte
d’eau.
Dans le quatre−vingt−neuvième genre des poissons classés par Lacépède,
qui appartient à la seconde sous−classe des osseux, caractérisés par un
opercule et une membrane bronchiale, je remarquai la scorpène, dont la
tête est garnie d’aiguillons et qui ne possède qu’une seule nageoire
dorsale ; ces animaux sont revêtus ou privés de petites écailles, suivant le
sous−genre auquel ils appartiennent. Le second sous−genre nous donna des
échantillons de dydactyles longs de trois à quatre décimètres, rayés de
jaune, mais dont la tête est d’un aspect fantastique. Quant au premier
sous−genre, il fournit plusieurs spécimens de ce poisson bizarre justement
surnommé « crapaud de mer », poisson à tête grande, tantôt creusée de
sinus profonds, tantôt boursouflée de protubérances ; hérissé d’aiguillons
et parsemé de tubercules, il porte des cornes irrégulières et hideuses ; son
corps et sa queue sont garnis de callosités ; ses piquants font des blessures
dangereuses ; il est répugnant et horrible.
Du 21 au 23 janvier, le Nautilus marcha à raison de deux cent cinquante
lieues par vingt−quatre heures, soit cinq cent quarante milles, ou
vingt−deux milles à l’heure.
Si nous reconnaissions au passage les diverses variétés de poissons, c’est
que ceux−ci, attirés par l’éclat électrique, cherchaient à nous
accompagner ; la plupart, distancés par cette vitesse, restaient bientôt en
arrière ; quelques−uns cependant parvenaient à se maintenir pendant un
certain temps dans les eaux du Nautilus.
Le 24 au matin, par 12°5’de latitude sud et 94°33’de longitude, nous
eûmes connaissance de l’île Keeling, soulèvement madréporique planté de
magnifiques cocos, et qui fut visitée par M. Darwin et le capitaine
Fitz−Roy. Le Nautilus prolongea à peu de distance les accores de cette île
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 242
déserte. Ses dragues rapportèrent de nombreux échantillons de polypes et
d’échinodermes, et des tests curieux de l’embranchement des mollusques.
Quelques précieux produits de l’espèce des dauphinules accrurent les
trésors du capitaine Nemo, auquel je joignis une astrée punctifère, sorte de
polypier parasite souvent fixé sur une coquille.
Bientôt l’île Keeling disparut sous l’horizon, et la route fut donnée au
nord−ouest vers la pointe de la péninsule indienne.
« Des terres civilisées, me dit ce jour−là Ned Land. Cela vaudra mieux que
ces îles de la Papouasie, où l’on rencontre plus de sauvages que de
chevreuils ! Sur cette terre indienne, monsieur le professeur, il y a des
routes, des chemins de fer, des villes anglaises, françaises et indoues. On
ne ferait pas cinq milles sans y rencontrer un compatriote. Hein ! est−ce
que le moment n’est pas venu de brûler la politesse au capitaine Nemo ?
— Non. Ned, non, répondis−je d’un ton très déterminé. Laissons courir,
comme vous dites, vous autres marins. Le Nautilus se rapproche des
continents habités. Il revient vers l’Europe, qu’il nous y conduise. Une fois
arrivés dans nos mers, nous verrons ce que la prudence nous conseillera de
tenter. D’ailleurs, je ne suppose pas que le capitaine Nemo nous permette
d’aller chasser sur les côtes du Malabar ou de Coromandel comme dans les
forêts de la Nouvelle−Guinée.
— Eh bien ! monsieur, ne peut−on se passer de sa permission ? »
Je ne répondis pas au Canadien. Je ne voulais pas discuter. Au fond, j’avais
à coeur d’épuiser jusqu’au bout les hasards de la destinée qui m’avait jeté à
bord du Nautilus.
A partir de l’île Keeling, notre marche se ralentit généralement. Elle fut
aussi plus capricieuse et nous entraîna souvent à de grandes profondeurs.
On fit plusieurs fois usage des plans inclinés que des leviers intérieurs
pouvaient placer obliquement à la ligne de flottaison. Nous allâmes ainsi
jusqu’à deux et trois kilomètres, mais sans jamais avoir vérifié les grands
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 243
fonds de cette mer indienne que des sondes de treize mille mètres n’ont pas
pu atteindre. Quant à la température des basses couches, le thermomètre
indiqua toujours invariablement quatre degrés au−dessus de zéro.
J’observai seulement que, dans les nappes supérieures, l’eau était toujours
plus froide sur les hauts fonds qu’en pleine mer.
Le 25 janvier, l’Océan étant absolument désert, le Nautilus passa la
journée à sa surface, battant les flots de sa puissante hélice et les faisant
rejaillir à une grande hauteur. Comment, dans ces conditions, ne l’eût−on
pas pris pour un cétacé gigantesque ? Je passai les trois quarts de cette
journée sur la plate−forme. Je regardais la mer. Rien à l’horizon, si ce
n’est, vers quatre heures du soir, un long steamer qui courait dans l’ouest à
contrebord. Sa mâture fut visible un instant, mais il ne pouvait apercevoir
le Nautilus, trop ras sur l’eau. Je pensai que ce bateau à vapeur appartenait
à la ligne péninsulaire et orientale qui fait le service de l’île de Ceyland à
Sydney, en touchant à la pointe du roi George et à Melbourne.
A cinq heures du soir. avant ce rapide crépuscule qui lie le jour à la nuit
dans les zones tropicales, Conseil et moi nous fûmes émerveillés par un
curieux spectacle.
Il est un charmant animal dont la rencontre, suivant les anciens, présageait
des chances heureuses. Aristote, Athénée, Pline, Oppien, avaient étudié ses
goûts et épuisé à son égard toute la poétique des savants de la Grèce et de
l’Italie. Ils l’appelèrent Nautilus et Pompylius. Mais la science moderne
n’a pas ratifié leur appellation, et ce mollusque est maintenant connu sous
le nom d’Argonaute.
Qui eût consulté Conseil eût appris de ce brave garçon que
l’embranchement des mollusques se divise en cinq classes ; que la
première classe, celle des céphalopodes dont les sujets sont tantôt nus,
tantôt testacés, comprend deux familles, celles des dibranchiaux et des
tétrabranchiaux, qui se distinguent par le nombre de leurs branches : que la
famille des dibranchiaux renferme trois genres, l’argonaute, le calmar et la
seiche, et que la famille des tétrabranchiaux n’en contient qu’un seul, le
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 244
nautile. Si après cette nomenclature. un esprit rebelle eût confondu
l’argonaute, qui est acétabulifère, c’est−à−dire porteur de ventouses, avec
le nautile, qui est tentaculifère, c’est−à−dire porteur de tentacules, il aurait
été sans excuse.
Or, c’était une troupe de ces argonautes qui voyageait alors à la surface de
l’Océan. Nous pouvions en compter plusieurs centaines. Ils appartenaient à
l’espèce des argonautes tuberculés qui est spéciale aux mers de l’Inde.
Ces gracieux mollusques se mouvaient à reculons au moyen de leur tube
locomoteur en chassant par ce tube l’eau qu’ils avaient aspirée. De leurs
huit tentacules. six. allongés et amincis. flottaient sur l’eau, tandis que les
deux autres arrondis en palmes, se tendaient au vent comme une voile
légère. Je voyais parfaitement leur coquille spiraliforme et ondulée que
Cuvier compare justement à une élégante chaloupe. Véritable bateau en
effet. Il transporte l’animal qui l’a sécrété, sans que l’animal y adhère.
« L’argonaute est libre de quitter sa coquille, dis−je à Conseil, mais il ne la
quitte jamais.
— Ainsi fait le capitaine Nemo. répondit judicieusement Conseil. C’est
pourquoi il eût mieux fait d’appeler son navire l’Argonaute. »
Pendant une heure environ. Le Nautilus flotta au milieu de cette troupe de
mollusques. Puis, je ne sais quel effroi les prit soudain. Comme à un
signal, toutes les voiles furent subitement amenées ; les bras se replièrent,
les corps se contractèrent. Les coquilles se renversant changèrent leur
centre de gravité, et toute la flottille disparut sous les flots. Ce fut
instantané, et jamais navires d’une escadre ne manoeuvrèrent avec plus
d’ensemble.
En ce moment, la nuit tomba subitement, et les lames, à peine soulevées
par la brise, s’allongèrent paisiblement sous les précintes du Nautilus.
Le lendemain, 26 janvier, nous coupions l’Équateur sur le
quatre−vingt−deuxième méridien, et nous rentrions dans l’hémisphère
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 245
boréal.
Pendant cette journée, une formidable troupe de squales nous fit cortège.
Terribles animaux qui pullulent dans ces mers et les rendent fort
dangereuses. C’étaient des squales philipps au dos brun et au ventre
blanchâtre armés de onze rangées de dents, des squales oeillés dont le cou
est marqué d’une grande tache noire cerclée de blanc qui ressemble à un
oeil. des squales isabelle à museau arrondi et semé de points obscurs.
Souvent, ces puissants animaux se précipitaient contre la vitre du salon
avec une violence peu rassurante. Ned Land ne se possédait plus alors. Il
voulait remonter à la surface des flots et harponner ces monstres, surtout
certains squales émissoles dont la gueule est pavée de dents disposées
comme une mosaïque, et de grands squales tigrés, longs de cinq mètres,
qui le provoquaient avec une insistance toute particulière. Mais bientôt le
Nautilus, accroissant sa vitesse, laissa facilement en arrière les plus rapides
de ces requins.
Le 27 janvier, à l’ouvert du vaste golfe du Bengale, nous rencontrâmes à
plusieurs reprises, spectacle sinistre ! des cadavres qui flottaient à la
surface des flots. C’étaient les morts des villes indiennes. charriés par le
Gange jusqu’à la haute mer, et que les vautours, les seuls ensevelisseurs du
pays, n’avaient pas achevé de dévorer. Mais les squales ne manquaient pas
pour les aider dans leur funèbre besogne.
Vers sept heures du soir, le Nautilus à demi immergé navigua au milieu
d’une mer de lait. A perte de vue l’Océan semblait être lactifié. Était−ce
l’effet des rayons lunaires ? Non, car la lune, ayant deux jours à peine, était
encore perdue au−dessous de l’horizon dans les rayons du soleil. Tout le
ciel, quoique éclairé par le rayonnement sidéral, semblait noir par contraste
avec la blancheur des eaux.
Conseil ne pouvait en croire ses yeux, et il m’interrogeait sur les causes de
ce singulier phénomène. Heureusement, j’étais en mesure de lui répondre.
« C’est ce qu’on appelle une mer de lait, lui dis−je, vaste étendue de flots
blancs qui se voit fréquemment sur les côtes d’Amboine et dans ces
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'océan indien 246
parages.
— Mais, demanda Conseil, monsieur peut−il m’apprendre quelle cause
produit un pareil effet. car cette eau ne s’est pas changée en lait, je
suppose !
— Non, mon garçon, et cette blancheur qui te surprend n’est due qu’à la
présence de myriades de bestioles infusoires, sortes de petits vers
lumineux, d’un aspect gélatineux et incolore, de l’épaisseur d’un cheveu,
et dont la longueur ne dépasse pas un cinquième de millimètre.
Quelques−unes de ces bestioles adhèrent entre elles pendant l’espace de
plusieurs lieues.
— Plusieurs lieues ! s’écria Conseil.
— Oui, mon garçon, et ne cherche pas à supputer le nombre de ces
infusoires ! Tu n’y parviendrais pas, car, si je ne me trompe, certains
navigateurs ont flotté sur ces mers de lait pendant plus de quarante milles.
»
Je ne sais si Conseil tint compte de ma recommandation, mais il parut se
plonger dans des réflexions profondes, cherchant sans doute à évaluer
combien quarante milles carrés contiennent de cinquièmes de millimètres.
Pour moi, je continuai d’observer le phénomène. Pendant plusieurs heures,
le Nautilus trancha de son éperon ces flots blanchâtres, et je remarquai
qu’il glissait sans bruit sur cette eau savonneuse, comme s’il eût flotté dans
ces remous d’écume que les courants et les contre−courants des baies
laissaient quelquefois entre eux.
Vers minuit, la mer reprit subitement sa teinte ordinaire, mais derrière
nous. jusqu’aux limites de l’horizon. Le ciel,
réfléchissant la blancheur des flots. sembla longtemps imprégné des
vagues lueurs d’une aurore boréale.
20 000 lieues sous les mers

Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine
Nemo
Le 28 février, lorsque le Nautilus revint à midi à la surface de la mer, par
9°4’de latitude nord, il se trouvait en vue d’une terre qui lui restait à huit
milles dans l’ouest. J’observai tout d’abord une agglomération de
montagnes, hautes de deux mille pieds environ, dont les formes se
modelaient très capricieusement. Le point terminé, je rentrai dans le salon,
et lorsque le relèvement eut été reporté sur la carte, je reconnus que nous
étions en présence de l’île de Ceylan, cette perle qui pend au lobe inférieur
de la péninsule indienne.
J’allai chercher dans la bibliothèque quelque livre relatif à cette île, l’une
des plus fertiles du globe. Je trouvai précisément un volume de Sirr H. C. ,
esq. , intitulé Ceylan and the Cingalese. Rentré au salon, je notai d’abord
les relèvements de Ceyland, à laquelle l’antiquité avait prodigué tant de
noms divers. Sa situation était entre 5°55’et 9°49’de latitude nord, et entre
79°42’et 82°4’de longitude à l’est du méridien de Greenwich ; sa longueur,
deux cent soixante−quinze milles ; sa largeur maximum, cent cinquante
milles ; sa circonférence. neuf cents milles ; sa superficie, vingt−quatre
mille quatre cent quarante−huit milles, c’est−à−dire un peu inférieure à
celle de l’Irlande.
Le capitaine Nemo et son second parurent en ce moment.
Le capitaine jeta un coup d’oeil sur la carte. Puis, se retournant vers moi :
« L’île de Ceylan, dit−il, une terre célèbre par ses pêcheries de perles.
Vous serait−il agréable, monsieur Aronnax, de visiter l’une de ses
pêcheries ?
— Sans aucun doute, capitaine.
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 248
— Bien. Ce sera chose facile. Seulement, si nous voyons les pêcheries,
nous ne verrons pas les pêcheurs. L’exploitation annuelle n’est pas encore
commencée. N’importe. Je vais donner l’ordre de rallier le golfe de
Manaar, où nous arriverons dans la nuit. »
Le capitaine dit quelques mots à son second qui sortit aussitôt. Bientôt le
Nautilus rentra dans son liquide élément, et le manomètre indiqua qu’il s’y
tenait à une profondeur de trente pieds.
La carte sous les yeux, je cherchai alors ce golfe de Manaar. Je le trouvai
par le neuvième parallèle, sur la côte nord−ouest de Ceylan. Il était formé
par une ligne allongée de la petite île Manaar. Pour l’atteindre, il fallait
remonter tout le rivage occidental de Ceylan.
« Monsieur le professeur, me dit alors le capitaine Nemo, on pêche des
perles dans le golfe du Bengale, dans la mer des Indes, dans les mers de
Chine et du Japon, dans les mers du sud de l’Amérique, au golfe de
Panama, au golfe de Californie ; mais c’est à Ceylan que cette pêche
obtient les plus beaux résultats. Nous arrivons un peu tôt, sans doute. Les
pêcheurs ne se rassemblent que pendant le mois de mars au golfe de
Manaar, et là, pendant trente jours, leurs trois cents bateaux se livrent à
cette lucrative exploitation des trésors de la mer. Chaque bateau est monté
par dix rameurs et par dix pêcheurs. Ceux−ci, divisés en deux groupes,
plongent alternativement et descendent à une profondeur de douze mètres
au moyen d’une lourde pierre qu’ils saisissent entre leurs pieds et qu’une
corde rattache au bateau.
— Ainsi, dis−je, c’est toujours ce moyen primitif qui est encore en usage ?
— Toujours, me répondit le capitaine Nemo, bien que ces pêcheries
appartiennent au peuple le plus industrieux du globe, aux Anglais,
auxquels le traité d’Amiens les a cédées en 1802.
— Il me semble, cependant, que le scaphandre, tel que vous l’employez,
rendrait de grands services dans une telle opération.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 249
— Oui, car ces pauvres pêcheurs ne peuvent demeurer longtemps sous
l’eau. L’Anglais Perceval, dans son voyage à Ceylan, parle bien d’un Cafre
qui restait cinq minutes sans remonter à la surface, mais le fait me paraît
peu croyable. Je sais que quelques plongeurs vont jusqu’à cinquante−sept
secondes, et de très habiles jusqu’à quatre−vingt−sept ; toutefois ils sont
rares, et, revenus à bord, ces malheureux rendent par le nez et les oreilles
de l’eau teintée de sang. Je crois que la moyenne de temps que les pêcheurs
peuvent supporter est de trente secondes, pendant lesquelles ils se hâtent
d’entasser dans un petit filet toutes les huîtres perlières qu’ils arrachent ;
mais, généralement, ces pêcheurs ne vivent pas vieux ; leur vue s’affaiblit ;
des ulcérations se déclarent à leurs yeux ; des plaies se forment sur leur
corps, et souvent même ils sont frappés d’apoplexie au fond de la mer.
— Oui, dis−je, c’est un triste métier, et qui ne sert qu’à la satisfaction de
quelques caprices. Mais, dites−moi, capitaine, quelle quantité d’huîtres
peut pêcher un bateau dans sa Journée ?
— Quarante à cinquante mille environ. On dit même qu’en 1814, le
gouvernement anglais ayant fait pêcher pour son propre compte, ses
plongeurs, dans vingt journées de travail, rapportèrent soixante−seize
millions d’huîtres.
— Au moins, demandai−je, ces pêcheurs sont−ils suffisamment rétribués ?
— A peine, monsieur le professeur. A Panama, ils ne gagnent qu’un dollar
par semaine. Le plus souvent, ils ont un sol par huître qui renferme une
perle, et combien en ramènent−ils qui n’en contiennent pas !
— Un sol à ces pauvres gens qui enrichissent leurs maîtres ! C’est odieux.
— Ainsi, monsieur le professeur, me dit le capitaine Nemo, vos
compagnons et vous, vous visiterez le banc de Manaar, et si par hasard
quelque pêcheur hâtif s’y trouve déjà, eh bien, nous le verrons opérer.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 250
— C’est convenu, capitaine.
— A propos, monsieur Aronnax, vous n’avez pas peur des requins ?
— Des requins ? » m’écriai−je.
Cette question me parut, pour le moins, très oiseuse.
« Eh bien ? reprit le capitaine Nemo.
— Je vous avouerai, capitaine, que je ne suis pas encore très familiarisé
avec ce genre de poissons.
— Nous y sommes habitués, nous autres, répliqua le capitaine Nemo, et
avec le temps, vous vous y ferez. D’ailleurs, nous serons armés, et, chemin
faisant, nous pourrons peut−être chasser quelque squale. C’est une chasse
intéressante. Ainsi donc, à demain, monsieur le professeur, et de grand
matin. »
Cela dit d’un ton dégagé, le capitaine Nemo quitta le salon.
On vous inviterait à chasser l’ours dans les montagnes de la Suisse, que
vous diriez : « Très bien ! demain nous irons chasser l’ours. » On vous
inviterait à chasser le lion dans les plaines de l’Atlas, ou le tigre dans les
jungles de l’Inde, que vous diriez : « Ah ! ah ! il paraît que nous allons
chasser le tigre ou le lion ! » Mais on vous inviterait à chasser le requin
dans son élément naturel, que vous demanderiez peut−être à réfléchir avant
d’accepter cette invitation.
Pour moi, je passai ma main sur mon front où perlaient quelques gouttes de
sueur froide.
« Réfléchissons, me dis−je, et prenons notre temps. Chasser des loutres
dans les forêts sous−marines, comme nous l’avons fait dans les forêts de
l’île Crespo, passe encore. Mais courir le fond des mers, quand on est à
peu près certain d’y rencontrer des squales, c’est autre chose ! Je sais bien
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 251
que dans certains pays, aux îles Andamènes particulièrement, les nègres
n’hésitent pas à attaquer le requin, un poignard dans une main et un lacet
dans l’autre, mais je sais aussi que beaucoup de ceux qui affrontent ces
formidables animaux ne reviennent pas vivants ! D’ailleurs, je ne suis pas
un nègre, et quand je serais un nègre, je crois que, dans ce cas, une légère
hésitation de ma part ne serait pas déplacée. »
Et me voilà rêvant de requins, songeant à ces vastes mâchoires armées de
multiples rangées de dents, et capables de couper un homme en deux. Je
me sentais déjà une certaine douleur autour des reins. Puis, je ne pouvais
digérer le sans−façon avec lequel le capitaine avait fait cette déplorable
invitation ! N’eût−on pas dit qu’il s’agissait d’aller traquer sous bois
quelque renard inoffensif ?
« Bon ! pensai−je, jamais Conseil ne voudra venir, et cela me dispensera
d’accompagner le capitaine. »
Quant à Ned Land, j’avoue que je ne me sentais pas aussi sûr de sa
sagesse. Un péril, si grand qu’il fût, avait toujours un attrait pour sa nature
batailleuse.
Je repris ma lecture du livre de Sirr, mais je le feuilletai machinalement. Je
voyais, entre les lignes, des mâchoires formidablement ouvertes.
En ce moment, Conseil et le Canadien entrèrent, l’air tranquille et même
joyeux. Ils ne savaient pas ce qui les attendait.
« Ma foi, monsieur, me dit Ned Land, votre capitaine Nemo que le diable
emporte ! – vient de nous faire une très aimable proposition.
— Ah ! dis−je, vous savez...
— N’en déplaise à monsieur, répondit Conseil, le commandant du Nautilus
nous a invités à visiter demain, en compagnie de monsieur, les
magnifiques pêcheries de Ceyland. Il l’a fait en termes excellents et s’est
conduit en véritable gentleman.

— Il ne vous a rien dit de plus ?
— Rien, monsieur, répondit le Canadien, si ce n’est qu’il vous avait parlé
de cette petite promenade.
— En effet, dis−je. Et il ne vous a donné aucun détail sur...
— Aucun, monsieur le naturaliste. Vous nous accompagnerez, n’est−il pas
vrai ?
— Moi... sans doute ! Je vois que vous y prenez goût, maître Land.
— Oui ! c’est curieux, très curieux.
— Dangereux peut−être ! ajoutai−je d’un ton insinuant.
— Dangereux, répondit Ned Land, une simple excursion sur un banc
d’huîtres ! »
Décidément le capitaine Nemo avait jugé inutile d’éveiller l’idée de
requins dans l’esprit de mes compagnons. Moi, je les regardais d’un oeil
troublé, et comme s’il leur manquait déjà quelque membre. Devais−je les
prévenir ? Oui, sans doute, mais je ne savais trop comment m’y prendre.
« Monsieur, me dit Conseil, monsieur voudra−t−il nous donner des détails
sur la pêche des perles ?
— Sur la pêche elle−même, demandai−je, ou sur les incidents qui...
— Sur la pêche, répondit le Canadien. Avant de s’engager sur le terrain, il
est bon de le connaître.
— Eh bien ! asseyez−vous, mes amis, et je vais vous apprendre tout ce que
l’Anglais Sirr vient de m’apprendre à moi−même. »

Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 253
Ned et Conseil prirent place sur un divan, et tout d’abord le Canadien me
dit :
« Monsieur, qu’est−ce que c’est qu’une perle ?
— Mon brave Ned, répondis−je, pour le poète, la perle est une larme de la
mer ; pour les Orientaux, c’est une goutte de rosée solidifiée ; pour les
dames, c’est un bijou de forme oblongue, d’un éclat hyalin, d’une matière
nacrée, qu’elles portent au doigt, au cou ou à l’oreille ; pour le chimiste,
c’est un mélange de phosphate et de carbonate de chaux avec un peu de
gélatine, et enfin, pour les naturalistes, c’est une simple sécrétion maladive
de l’organe qui produit la nacre chez certains bivalves.
— Embranchement des mollusques, dit Conseil, classe des acéphales,
ordre des testacés.
— Précisément, savant Conseil. Or, parmi ces testacés, l’oreille−de−mer
iris, les turbots, les tridacnes, les pinnesmarines, en un mot tous ceux qui
sécrètent la nacre c’est−à− dire cette substance bleue, bleuâtre, violette ou
blanche, qui tapisse l’intérieur de leurs valves, sont susceptibles de
produire des perles.
— Les moules aussi ? demanda le Canadien.
— Oui ! les moules de certains cours d’eau de l’Ecosse, du pays de Galles,
de l’Irlande, de la Saxe, de la Bohème, de la France.
— Bon ! on y fera attention, désormais, répondit le Canadien.
— Mais, repris−je, le mollusque par excellence qui distille la perle, c’est
l’huître perlière, la méléagrina−Margaritiferala précieuse pintadine. La
perle n’est qu’une concrétion nacrée qui se dispose sous une forme
globuleuse. Ou elle adhère à la coquille de l’huître, ou elle s’incruste dans
les plis de l’animal. Sur les valves, la perle est adhérente ; sur les chairs,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 254
elle est libre. Mais elle a toujours pour noyau un petit corps dur, soit un
ovule stérile, soit un grain de sable, autour duquel la matière nacrée se
dépose en plusieurs années, successivement et par couches minces et
concentriques.
— Trouve−t−on plusieurs perles dans une même huître ? demanda
Conseil.
— Oui, mon garçon. Il y a de certaines pintadines qui forment un véritable
écrin. On a même cité une huître, mais je me permets d’en douter, qui ne
contenait pas moins de cent cinquante requins.
— Cent cinquante requins ! s’écria Ned Land.
— Ai−je dit requins ? m’écriai−je vivement. Je veux dire cent cinquante
perles. Requins n’aurait aucun sens.
— En effet, dit Conseil. Mais monsieur nous apprendra−t−il maintenant
par quels moyens on extrait ces perles ?
— On procède de plusieurs façons, et souvent même, quand les perles
adhèrent aux valves, les pêcheurs les arrachent avec des pinces. Mais, le
plus communément, les pintadines sont étendues sur des nattes de sparterie
qui couvrent le rivage. Elles meurent ainsi à l’air libre, et, au bout de dix
jours, elles se trouvent dans un état satisfaisant de putréfaction. On les
plonge alors dans de vastes réservoirs d’eau de mer, puis on les ouvre et on
les lave. C’est à ce moment que commence le double travail des rogueurs.
D’abord, ils séparent les plaques de nacre connues dans le commerce sous
le nom de franche argentée, de bâtarde blanche et de batarde noire, qui
sont livrées par caisses de cent vingt−cinq à cent cinquante kilogrammes.
Puis, ils enlèvent le parenchyme de l’huître, ils le font bouillir, et ils le
tamisent afin d’en extraire jusqu’aux plus petites perles.
— Le prix de ces perles varie suivant leur grosseur ? demanda Conseil.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 255
— Non seulement selon leur grosseur, répondis−je, mais aussi selon leur
forme, selon leur eau, c’est−à−dire leur couleur, et selon leur orient,
c’est−à−dire cet éclat chatoyant et diapré qui les rend si charmantes a
l’oeil. Les plus belles perles sont appelées perles vierges ou paragons ;
elles se forment isolément dans le tissu du mollusque ; elles sont blanches,
souvent opaques, mais quelquefois d’une transparence opaline, et le plus
communément sphériques ou piriformes. Sphériques, elles forment les
bracelets ; piriformes, des pendeloques, et, étant les plus précieuses, elles
se vendent à la pièce. Les autres perles adhèrent à la coquille de l’huître, et,
plus irrégulières, elles se vendent au poids. Enfin, dans un ordre inférieur
se classent les petites perles, connues sous le nom de semences ; elles se
vendent à la mesure et servent plus particulièrement à exécuter des
broderies sur les ornements d’église.
— Mais ce travail, qui consiste à séparer les perles selon leur grosseur, doit
être long et difficile, dit le Canadien.
— Non, mon ami. Ce travail se fait au moyen de onze tamis ou cribles
percés d’un nombre variable de trous. Les perles qui restent dans les tamis,
qui comptent de vingt à quatre−vingts trous, sont de premier ordre. Celles
qui ne s’échappent pas des cribles percés de cent à huit cents trous sont de
second ordre. Enfin, les perles pour lesquelles l’on emploie les tamis
percés de neuf cents à mille trous forment la semence.
— C’est ingénieux, dit Conseil, et je vois que la division, le classement des
perles, s’opère mécaniquement. Et monsieur pourra−t−il nous dire ce que
rapporte l’exploitation des bancs d’huîtres perlières ?
— A s’en tenir au livre de Sirr, répondis−je, les pêcheries de Ceylan sont
affermées annuellement pour la somme de trois millions de squales.
— De francs ! reprit Conseil.
— Oui, de francs ! Trois millions de francs, repris−je. Mais je crois que
ces pêcheries ne rapportent plus ce qu’elles rapportaient autrefois. Il en est
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 256
de même des pêcheries américaines, qui, sous le règne de Charles Quint,
produisaient quatre millions de francs, présentement réduits aux deux tiers.
En somme, on peut évaluer à neuf millions de francs le rendement général
de l’exploitation des perles.
— Mais, demanda Conseil, est−ce que l’on ne cite pas quelques perles
célèbres qui ont été cotées à un très haut prix ?
— Oui, mon garçon. On dit que César offrit à Servillia une perle estimée
cent vingt mille francs de notre monnaie.
— J’ai même entendu raconter, dit le Canadien, qu’une certaine dame
antique buvait des perles dans son vinaigre.
— Cléopâtre, riposta Conseil.
— Ça devait être mauvais, ajouta Ned Land.
— Détestable, ami Ned, répondit Conseil ; mais un petit verre de vinaigre
qui coûte quinze cents mille francs, c’est d’un joli prix.
— Je regrette de ne pas avoir épousé cette dame, dit le Canadien en
manoeuvrant son bras d’un air peu rassurant.
— Ned Land l’époux de Cléopâtre ! s’écria Conseil.
— Mais j’ai dû me marier, Conseil, répondit sérieusement le Canadien, et
ce n’est pas ma faute si l’affaire n’a pas réussi. J’avais même acheté un
collier de perles à Kat Tender, ma fiancée, qui, d’ailleurs, en a épousé un
autre. Eh bien, ce collier ne m’avait pas coûté plus d’un dollar et demi, et
cependant – monsieur le professeur voudra bien me croire les perles qui le
composaient n’auraient pas passé par le tamis de vingt trous.
— Mon brave Ned, répondis−je en riant, c’étaient des perles artificielles,
de simples globules de verre enduits à l’intérieur d’essence d’Orient.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 257
— Si peu que rien ! Ce n’est autre chose que la substance argentée de
l’écaille de l’ablette, recueillie dans l’eau et conservée dans l’ammoniaque.
Elle n’a aucune valeur.
— C’est peut−être pour cela que Kat Tender en a épousé un autre, répondit
philosophiquement maître Land.
— Mais, dis−je, pour en revenir aux perles de haute valeur, je ne crois pas
que jamais souverain en ait possédé une supérieure à celle du capitaine
Nemo.
— Celle−ci, dit Conseil, en montrant le magnifique bijou enfermé sous sa
vitrine.
— Certainement, je ne me trompe pas en lui assignant une valeur de deux
millions de...
— Francs ! dit vivement Conseil.
— Oui, dis−je, deux millions de francs, et, sans doute elle n’aura coûté au
capitaine que la peine de la ramasser.
— Eh ! s’écria Ned Land, qui dit que demain, pendant notre promenade,
nous ne rencontrerons pas sa pareille !
— Bah ! fit Conseil.
— Et pourquoi pas ?
— A quoi des millions nous serviraient−ils à bord du Nautilus ?
— A bord, non, dit Ned Land, mais... ailleurs.
— Oh ! ailleurs ! fit Conseil en secouant la tête.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 258
— Au fait, dis−je, maître Land a raison. Et si nous rapportons jamais en
Europe ou en Amérique une perle de quelques millions, voilà du moins qui
donnera une grande authenticité, et, en même temps, un grand prix au récit
de nos aventures.
— Je le crois, dit le Canadien.
— Mais, dit Conseil, qui revenait toujours au côté instructif des choses,
est−ce que cette pêche des perles est dangereuse ?
— Non, répondis−je vivement, surtout si l’on prend certaines précautions.
— Que risque−t−on dans ce métier ? dit Ned Land : d’avaler quelques
gorgées d’eau de mer !
— Comme vous dites, Ned. A propos, dis−je, en essayant de prendre le ton
dégagé du capitaine Nemo, est−ce que vous avez peur des requins, brave
Ned ?
— Moi, répondit le Canadien, un harponneur de profession ! C’est mon
métier de me moquer d’eux !
— Il ne s’agit pas, dis−je, de les pêcher avec un émerillon, de les hisser sur
le pont d’un navire, de leur couper la queue à coups de hache, de leur
ouvrir le ventre, de leur arracher le coeur et de le jeter à la mer !
— Alors, il s’agit de... ?
— Oui, précisément.
— Dans l’eau ?
— Dans l’eau.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 259
— Ma foi, avec un bon harpon ! Vous savez, monsieur, ces requins, ce
sont des bêtes assez mal façonnées. Il faut qu’elles se retournent sur le
ventre pour vous happer, et, pendant ce temps... »
Ned Land avait une manière de prononcer le mot « happer » qui donnait
froid dans le dos.
« Eh bien, et toi, Conseil, que penses−tu de ces squales ?
— Moi, dit Conseil, je serai franc avec monsieur.
— A la bonne heure, pensai−je.
— Si monsieur affronte les requins, dit Conseil, je ne vois pas pourquoi
son fidèle domestique ne les affronterait pas avec lui ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une nouvelle proposition du capitaine... 260
Une perle de dix millions
La nuit arriva. Je me couchai. Je dormis assez mal. Les squales jouèrent un
rôle important dans mes rêves, et je trouvai très juste et très injuste à la fois
cette étymologie qui fait venir le mot requin du mot « requiem ».
Le lendemain, à quatre heures du matin, je fus réveillé par le stewart que le
capitaine Nemo avait spécialement mis à mon service. Je me levai
rapidement, je m’habillai et je passai dans le salon.
Le capitaine Nemo m’y attendait.
« Monsieur Aronnax, me dit−il, êtes−vous prêt à partir ?
— Je suis prêt.
— Veuillez me suivre.
— Et mes compagnons, capitaine ?
— Ils sont prévenus et nous attendent.
— N’allons−nous pas revêtir nos scaphandres ? demandai−je.
— Pas encore. Je n’ai pas laissé le Nautilus approcher de trop près cette
côte, et nous sommes assez au large du banc de Manaar ; mais j’ai fait
parer le canot qui nous conduira au point précis de débarquement et nous
épargnera un assez long trajet. Il emporte nos appareils de plongeurs, que
nous revêtirons au moment où commencera cette exploration sous−marine.
»
Le capitaine Nemo me conduisit vers l’escalier central, dont les marches
Une perle de dix millions 261
aboutissaient à la plate−forme. Ned et Conseil se trouvaient là, enchantés
de la « partie de plaisir « qui se préparait. Cinq matelots du Nautilus, les
avirons armés, nous attendaient dans le canot qui avait été bossé contre le
bord.
La nuit était encore obscure. Des plaques de nuages couvraient le ciel et ne
laissaient apercevoir que de rares étoiles. Je portai mes yeux du côté de la
terre, mais je ne vis qu’une ligne trouble qui fermait les trois quarts de
l’horizon du sud−ouest au nord−ouest. Le Nautilus, ayant remonté pendant
la nuit la côte occidentale de Ceylan, se trouvait à l’ouest de la baie, ou
plutôt de ce golfe formé par cette terre et l’île de Manaar. Là, sous les
sombres eaux, s’étendait le banc de pintadines, inépuisable champ de
perles dont la longueur dépasse vingt milles.
Le capitaine Nemo, Conseil, Ned Land et moi. nous prîmes place à
l’arrière du canot. Le patron de l’embarcation se mit à la barre ; ses quatre
compagnons appuyèrent sur leurs avirons ; la bosse fut larguée et nous
débordâmes.
Le canot se dirigea vers le sud. Ses nageurs ne se pressaient pas. J’observai
que leurs coups d’aviron, vigoureusement engagés sous l’eau, ne se
succédaient que de dix secondes en dix secondes, suivant la méthode
généralement usitée dans les marines de guerre. Tandis que l’embarcation
courait sur son erre, les gouttelettes liquides frappaient en crépitant le fond
noir des flots comme des bavures de plomb fondu. Une petite houle, venue
du large, imprimait au canot un léger roulis, et quelques crêtes de lames
clapotaient à son avant.
Nous étions silencieux. A quoi songeait le capitaine Nemo ? Peut−être à
cette terre dont il s’approchait. et qu’il trouvait trop près de lui,
contrairement a l’opinion du Canadien, auquel elle semblait encore trop
éloignée. Quant à Conseil, il était là en simple curieux.
Vers cinq heures et demie, les premières teintes de l’horizon accusèrent
plus nettement la ligne supérieure de la côte. Assez plate dans l’est, elle se
renflait un peu vers le sud. Cinq milles la séparaient encore, et son rivage
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 262
se confondait avec les eaux brumeuses. Entre elle et nous, la mer était
déserte. Pas un bateau, pas un plongeur. Solitude profonde sur ce lieu de
rendez−vous des pêcheurs de perles. Ainsi que le capitaine Nemo me
l’avait fait observer, nous arrivions un mois trop tôt dans ces parages.
A six heures, le jour se fit subitement, avec cette rapidité particulière aux
régions tropicales, qui ne connaissent ni l’aurore ni le crépuscule. Les
rayons solaires percèrent le rideau de nuages amoncelés sur l’horizon
oriental, et l’astre radieux s’éleva rapidement.
Je vis distinctement la terre, avec quelques arbres épars çà et là.
Le canot s’avança vers l’île de Manaar, qui s’arrondissait dans le sud. Le
capitaine Nemo s’était levé de son banc et observait la mer.
Sur un signe de lui, l’ancre fut mouillée, et la chaîne courut à peine, car le
fond n’était pas à plus d’un mètre, et il formait en cet endroit l’un des plus
hauts points du banc de pintadines. Le canot évita aussitôt sous la poussée
du jusant qui portait au large.
« Nous voici arrivés, monsieur Aronnax, dit alors le capitaine Nemo. Vous
voyez cette baie resserrée. C’est ici même que dans un mois se réuniront
les nombreux bateaux de pêche des exploitants, et ce sont ces eaux que
leurs plongeurs iront audacieusement fouiller. Cette baie est heureusement
disposée pour ce genre de pêche. Elle est abritée des vents les plus forts, et
la mer n’y est jamais très houleuse, circonstance très favorable au travail
des plongeurs. Nous allons maintenant revêtir nos scaphandres, et nous
commencerons notre promenade. »
aidé des matelots de l’embarcation, je commençai à revêtir mon lourd
vêtement de mer. Le capitaine Nemo et mes deux compagnons
s’habillaient aussi. Aucun des hommes du Nautilus ne devait nous
accompagner dans cette nouvelle excursion.
Bientôt nous fûmes emprisonnés jusqu’au cou dans le vêtement de
caoutchouc, et des bretelles fixèrent sur notre dos les appareils à air. Quant
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 263
aux appareils Ruhmkorff, il n’en était pas question. Avant d’introduire ma
tête dans sa capsule de cuivre, j’en fis l’observation au capitaine.
« Ces appareils nous seraient inutiles, me répondit le capitaine. Nous
n’irons pas à de grandes profondeurs, et les rayons solaires suffiront à
éclairer notre marche. D’ailleurs, il n’est pas prudent d’emporter sous ces
eaux une lanterne électrique. Son éclat pourrait attirer inopinément quelque
dangereux habitant de ces parages. »
Pendant que le capitaine Nemo prononçait ces paroles, je me retournai vers
Conseil et Ned Land. Mais ces deux amis avaient déjà emboîté leur tête
dans la calotte métallique, et ils ne pouvaient ni entendre ni répondre.
Une dernière question me restait à adresser au capitaine Nemo :
« Et nos armes, lui demandai−je, nos fusils ?
_ Des fusils ! à quoi bon ? Vos montagnards n’attaquent−ils pas l’ours un
poignard à la main, et l’acier n’est−il pas plus sûr que le plomb ? Voici une
lame solide. Passez−la à votre ceinture et partons. »
Je regardai mes compagnons. Ils étaient armés comme nous, et, de plus,
Ned Land brandissait un énorme harpon qu’il avait déposé dans le canot
avant de quitter le Nautilus.
Puis, suivant l’exemple du capitaine, je me laissai coiffer de la pesante
sphère de cuivre, et nos réservoirs a air furent immédiatement mis en
activité.
Un instant après, les matelots de l’embarcation nous débarquaient les uns
après les autres, et, par un mètre et demi d’eau, nous prenions pied sur un
sable uni. Le capitaine Nemo nous fit un signe de la main. Nous le
suivîmes, et par une pente douce nous disparûmes sous les flots.
Là, les idées qui obsédaient mon cerveau m’abandonnèrent. Je redevins
étonnamment calme. La facilité de mes mouvements accrut ma confiance,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 264
et l’étrangeté du spectacle captiva mon imagination.
Le soleil envoyait déjà sous les eaux une clarté suffisante. Les moindres
objets restaient perceptibles. Après dix minutes de marche, nous étions par
cinq mètres d’eau, et le terrain devenait à peu près plat.
Sur nos pas, comme des compagnies de bécassines dans un marais, se
levaient des volées de poissons curieux du genre des monoptères, dont les
sujets n’ont d’autre nageoire que celle de la queue. Je reconnus le javanais,
véritable serpent long de huit décimètres, au ventre livide, que l’on
confondrait facilement avec le congre sans les lignes d’or de ses flancs.
Dans le genre des stromatées, dont le corps est très comprimé et ovale,
j’observai des parus aux couleurs éclatantes portant comme une faux leur
nageoire dorsale, poissons comestibles qui, séchés et marinés, forment un
mets excellent connu sous le nom de karawade puis des tranquebars,
appartenant au genre des apsiphoroïdes, dont le corps est recouvert d’une
cuirasse écailleuse à huit pans longitudinaux.
Cependant l’élévation progressive du soleil éclairait de plus en plus la
masse des eaux. Le sol changeait peu à peu. Au sable fin succédait une
véritable chaussée de rochers arrondis, revêtus d’un tapis de mollusques et
de zoophytes. Parmi les échantillons de ces deux embranchements, je
remarquai des placènes à valves minces et inégales, sortes d’ostracées
particulières à la mer Rouge et à l’océan Indien, des lucines orangées à
coquille orbiculaire, des tarières subulées, quelques−unes de ces pourpres
persiques qui fournissaient au Nautilus une teinture admirable, des rochers
cornus, longs de quinze centimètres, qui se dressaient sous les flots comme
des mains prêtes à vous saisir, des turbinelles cornigères, toutes hérissées
d’épines, des lingules hyantes, des anatines, coquillages comestibles qui
alimentent les marchés de l’Hindoustan, des pélagies panopyres,
légèrement lumineuses, et enfin d’admirables oculines flabelliformes,
magnifiques éventails qui forment l’une des plus riches arborisations de
ces mers.
Au milieu de ces plantes vivantes et sous les berceaux d’hydrophytes
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 265
couraient de gauches légions d’articulés, particulièrement des ranines
dentées, dont la carapace représente un triangle un peu arrondi, des birgues
spéciales à ces parages, des parthenopes horribles, dont l’aspect répugnait
aux regards. Un animal non moins hideux que je rencontrai plusieurs fois,
ce fut ce crabe énorme observé par M. Darwin, auquel la nature a donné
l’instinct et la force nécessaires pour se nourrir de noix de coco ; il grimpe
aux arbres du rivage, il fait tomber la noix qui se fend dans sa chute, et il
l’ouvre avec ses puissantes pinces. Ici, sous ces flots clairs, ce crabe
courait avec une agilité sans pareille, tandis que des chélonées franches, de
cette espèce qui fréquente les côtes du Malabar, se déplaçaient lentement
entre les roches ébranlées.
Vers sept heures, nous arpentions enfin le banc de pintadines, sur lequel les
huîtres perlières se reproduisent par millions. Ces mollusques précieux
adhéraient aux rocs et y étaient fortement attachés par ce byssus de couleur
brune qui ne leur permet pas de se déplacer. En quoi ces huîtres sont
inférieures aux moules elles−mêmes auxquelles la nature n’a pas refusé
toute faculté de locomotion.
La pintadine meleagrina, la mère perle, dont les valves sont à peu près
égales, se présente sous la forme d’une coquille arrondie, aux épaisses
parois, très rugueuses à l’extérieur. Quelques−unes de ces coquilles étaient
feuilletées et sillonnées de bandes verdâtres qui rayonnaient de leur
sommet. Elles appartenaient aux jeunes huîtres. Les autres, à surface rude
et noire, vieilles de dix ans et plus, mesuraient jusqu’à quinze centimètres
de largeur.
Le capitaine Nemo me montra de la main cet amoncellement prodigieux de
pintadines, et je compris que cette mine était véritablement inépuisable, car
la force créatrice de la nature l’emporte sur l’instinct destructif de
l’homme. Ned Land, fidèle a cet instinct, se hâtait d’emplir des plus beaux
mollusques un filet qu’il portait à son côté.
Mais nous ne pouvions nous arrêter. Il fallait suivre le capitaine qui
semblait se diriger par des sentiers connus de lui seul. Le sol remontait
sensiblement, et parfois mon bras, que j’élevais, dépassait la surface de la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 266
mer. Puis le niveau du banc se rabaissait capricieusement. Souvent nous
tournions de hauts rocs effilés en pyramidions. Dans leurs sombres
anfractuosités de gros crustacés, pointés sur leurs hautes pattes comme des
machines de guerre, nous regardaient de leurs yeux fixes, et sous nos pieds
rampaient des myrianes, des glycères, des aricies et des annélides, qui
allongeaient démesurément leurs antennes et leurs cyrrhes tentaculaires.
En ce moment s’ouvrit devant nos pas une vaste grotte, creusée dans un
pittoresque entassement de rochers tapissés de toutes les hautes−lisses de
la flore sous−marine. D’abord, cette grotte me parut profondément
obscure. Les rayons solaires semblaient s’y éteindre par dégradations
successives. Sa vague transparence n’était plus que de la lumière noyée.
Le capitaine Nemo y entra. Nous après lui. Mes yeux s’accoutumèrent
bientôt à ces ténèbres relatives. Je distinguai les retombées si
capricieusement contournées de la voûte que supportaient des piliers
naturels, largement assis sur leur base granitique, comme les lourdes
colonnes de l’architecture toscane. Pourquoi notre incompréhensible guide
nous entraînait−il au fond de cette crypte sous−marine ? J’allais le savoir
avant peu.
Après avoir descendu une pente assez raide, nos pieds foulèrent le fond
d’une sorte de puits circulaire. Là, le capitaine Nemo s’arrêta, et de la main
il nous indiqua un objet que je n’avais pas encore aperçu.
C’était une huître de dimension extraordinaire, une tridacne gigantesque,
un bénitier qui eût contenu un lac d’eau sainte, une vasque dont la largeur
dépassait deux mètres, et conséquemment plus grande que celle qui ornait
le salon du Nautilus.
Je m’approchai de ce mollusque phénoménal. Par son byssus il adhérait à
une table de granit, et là il se développait isolément dans les eaux calmes
de la grotte. J’estimai le poids de cette tridacne à trois cents kilogrammes.
Or, une telle huître contient quinze kilos de chair, et il faudrait l’estomac
d’un Gargantua pour en absorber quelques douzaines.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 267
Le capitaine Nemo connaissait évidemment l’existence de ce bivalve. Ce
n’était pas la première fois qu’il le visitait, et je pensais qu’en nous
conduisant en cet endroit il voulait seulement nous montrer une curiosité
naturelle. Je me trompais. Le capitaine Nemo avait un intérêt particulier à
constater l’état actuel de cette tridacne.
Les deux valves du mollusque étaient entr’ouvertes. Le capitaine
s’approcha et introduisit son poignard entre les coquilles pour les
empêcher de se rabattre ; puis, de la main, il souleva la tunique
membraneuse et frangée sur ses bords qui formait le manteau de l’animal.
Là, entre les plis foliacés, je vis une perle libre dont la grosseur égalait
celle d’une noix de cocotier. Sa forme globuleuse, sa limpidité parfaite,
son orient admirable en faisaient un bijou d’un inestimable prix. Emporté
par la curiosité, j’étendais la main pour la saisir, pour la peser, pour la
palper ! Mais le capitaine m’arrêta, fit un signe négatif, et, retirant son
poignard par un mouvement rapide, il laissa les deux valves se refermer
subitement.
Je compris alors quel était le dessein du capitaine Nemo. En laissant cette
perle enfouie sous le manteau de la tridacne, il lui permettait de s’accroître
insensiblement. Avec chaque année la sécrétion du mollusque y ajoutait de
nouvelles couches concentriques. Seul, le capitaine connaissait la grotte où
« mûrissait » cet admirable fruit de la nature ; seul il l’élevait, pour ainsi
dire, afin de la transporter un jour dans son précieux musée. Peut−être
même, suivant l’exemple des Chinois et des Indiens, avait−il déterminé la
production de cette perle en introduisant sous les plis du mollusque
quelque morceau de verre et de métal, qui s’était peu à peu recouvert de la
matière nacrée. En tout cas, comparant cette perle à celles que je
connaissais déjà, à celles qui brillaient dans la collection du capitaine,
j’estimai sa valeur à dix millions de francs au moins. Superbe curiosité
naturelle et non bijou de luxe, car je ne sais quelles oreilles féminines
auraient pu la supporter.
La visite à l’opulente tridacne était terminée. Le capitaine Nemo quitta la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 268
grotte, et nous remontâmes sur le banc de pintadines, au milieu de ces eaux
claires que ne troublait pas encore le travail des plongeurs.
Nous marchions isolément, en véritables flâneurs, chacun s’arrêtant ou
s’éloignant au gré de sa fantaisie. Pour mon compte, je n’avais plus aucun
souci des dangers que mon imagination avait exagérés si ridiculement. Le
haut−fond se rapprochait sensiblement de la surface de la mer, et bientôt
par un mètre d’eau ma tête dépassa le niveau océanique. Conseil me
rejoignit, et collant sa grosse capsule à la mienne, il me fit des yeux un
salut amical. Mais ce plateau élevé ne mesurait que quelques toises, et
bientôt nous fûmes rentrés dans notre élément. Je crois avoir maintenant le
droit de le qualifier ainsi.
Dix minutes après, le capitaine Nemo s’arrêtait soudain. Je crus qu’il
faisait halte pour retourner sur ses pas. Non. D’un geste, il nous ordonna de
nous blottir près de lui au fond d’une large anfractuosité. Sa main se
dirigea vers un point de la masse liquide, et je regardai attentivement.
A cinq mètres de moi, une ombre apparut et s’abaissa jusqu’au sol.
L’inquiétante idée des requins traversa mon esprit. Mais je me trompais, et,
cette fois encore, nous n’avions pas affaire aux monstres de l’Océan.
C’était un homme, un homme vivant, un Indien, un noir, un pêcheur, un
pauvre diable, sans doute, qui venait glaner avant la récolte. J’apercevais
les fonds de son canot mouillé à quelques pieds au−dessus de sa tête. Il
plongeait, et remontait successivement. Une pierre taillée en pain de sucre
et qu’il serrait du pied, tandis qu’une corde la rattachait à son bateau, lui
servait à descendre plus rapidement au fond de la mer. C’était là tout son
outillage. Arrivé au sol, par cinq mètres de profondeur environ, il se
précipitait à genoux et remplissait son sac de pintadines ramassées au
hasard. Puis, il remontait, vidait son sac, ramenait sa pierre, et
recommençait son opération qui ne durait que trente secondes.
Ce plongeur ne nous voyait pas. L’ombre du rocher nous dérobait a ses
regards. Et d’ailleurs, comment ce pauvre Indien aurait−il jamais supposé
que des hommes, des êtres semblables à lui, fussent là, sous les eaux,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 269
épiant ses mouvements. ne perdant aucun détail de sa pêche !
Plusieurs fois, il remonta ainsi et plongea de nouveau. Il ne rapportai pas
plus d’une dizaine de pintadines à chaque plongée, car il fallait les arracher
du banc auquel elles s’accrochaient par leur robuste byssus. Et combien de
ces huîtres étaient privées de ces perles pour lesquelles il risquait sa vie !
Je l’observais avec une attention profonde. Sa manoeuvre se faisait
régulièrement, et pendant une demi−heure, aucun danger ne parut le
menacer. Je me familiarisais donc avec le spectacle de cette pêche
intéressante, quand, tout d’un coup, à un moment où l’Indien était
agenouillé sur le sol, je lui vis faire un geste d’effroi ? se relever et prendre
son élan pour remonter à la surface des flots.
Je compris son épouvante. Une ombre gigantesque apparaissait au−dessus
du malheureux plongeur. C’était un requin de grande taille qui s’avançait
diagonalement, l’oeil en feu, les mâchoires ouvertes !
J’étais muet d’horreur, incapable de faire un mouvement.
Le vorace animal, d’un vigoureux coup de nageoire, s’élança vers l’Indien,
qui se jeta de côté et évita la morsure du requin, mais non le battement de
sa queue, car cette queue, le frappant à la poitrine, l'étendit sur le sol.
Cette scène avait duré quelques secondes à peine. Le requin revint, et, se
retournant sur le dos, il s’apprêtait à couper l’Indien en deux, quand je
sentis le capitaine Nemo, posté près de moi, se lever subitement. Puis, son
poignard à la main, il marcha droit au monstre, prêt à lutter corps à corps
avec lui.
Le squale, au moment où il allait happer le malheureux pêcheur, aperçut
son nouvel adversaire, et se replaçant sur le ventre, il se dirigea rapidement
vers lui.
Je vois encore la pose du capitaine Nemo. Replié sur lui−même, il attendait
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 270
avec un admirable sang−froid le formidable squale, et lorsque celui−ci se
précipita sur lui, le capitaine, se jetant de côté avec une prestesse
prodigieuse, évita le choc et lui enfonça son poignard dans le ventre. Mais,
tout n’était pas dit. Un combat terrible s’engagea.
Le requin avait rugi, pour ainsi dire. Le sang sortait à flots de ses blessures.
La mer se teignit de rouge, et, à travers ce liquide opaque, je ne vis plus
rien. Plus rien, jusqu’au moment où, dans une éclaircie, j’aperçus
l’audacieux capitaine, cramponné à l’une des nageoires de l’animal, luttant
corps à corps avec le monstre, labourant de coups de poignard le ventre de
son ennemi, sans pouvoir toutefois porter le coup définitif, c’est−à−dire
l’atteindre en plein coeur. Le squale, se débattant, agitait la masse des eaux
avec furie, et leur remous menaçait de me renverser.
J’aurais voulu courir au secours du capitaine. Mais, cloué par l’horreur, je
ne pouvais remuer.
Je regardais, l’oeil hagard. Je voyais les phases de la lutte se modifier. Le
capitaine tomba sur le sol, renversé par la masse énorme qui pesait sur lui.
Puis, les mâchoires du requin s’ouvrirent démesurément comme une
cisaille d’usine, et c’en était fait du capitaine si, prompt comme la pensée,
son harpon à la main, Ned Land, se précipitant vers le requin, ne l’eût
frappe de sa terrible pointe.
Les flots s’imprégnèrent d’une masse de sang. Ils s’agitèrent sous les
mouvements du squale qui les battait avec une indescriptible fureur. Ned
Land n’avait pas manqué son but. C’était le râle du monstre. Frappé au
coeur, il se débattait dans des spasmes épouvantables, dont le contrecoup
renversa Conseil.
Cependant, Ned Land avait dégagé le capitaine. Celui−ci, relevé sans
blessures, alla droit à l’indien, coupa vivement la corde qui le liait à sa
pierre, le prit dans ses bras et, d’un vigoureux coup de talon, il remonta à la
surface de la mer.
Nous le suivîmes tous trois, et, en quelques instants, miraculeusement
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 271
sauvés, nous atteignions l’embarcation du pêcheur.
Le premier soin du capitaine Nemo fut de rappeler ce malheureux à la vie.
Je ne savais s’il réussirait. Je l’espérais, car l’immersion de ce pauvre
diable n’avait pas été longue. Mais le coup de queue du requin pouvait
l’avoir frappé à mort.
Heureusement, sous les vigoureuses frictions de Conseil et du capitaine, je
vis, peu à peu, le noyé revenir au sentiment. Il ouvrit les yeux. Quelle dut
être sa surpris−je son épouvante même, à voir les quatre grosses têtes de
cuivre qui se penchaient sur lui !
Et surtout, que dut−il penser, quand le capitaine Nemo, tirant d’une poche
de son vêtement un sachet de perles, le lui eut mis dans la main ? Cette
magnifique aumône de l’homme des eaux au pauvre Indien de Ceylan fut
acceptée par celui−ci d’une main tremblante.
Ses yeux effarés indiquaient du reste qu’il ne savait à quels êtres
surhumains il devait à la fois la fortune et la vie.
Sur un signe du capitaine, nous regagnâmes le banc de pintadines, et,
suivant la route déjà parcourue, après une demi−heure de marche nous
rencontrions l’ancre qui rattachait au sol le canot du Nautilus.
Une fois embarqués, chacun de nous, avec l’aide des matelots, se
débarrassa de sa lourde carapace de cuivre.
La première parole du capitaine Nemo fut pour le Canadien.
« Merci, maître Land, lui dit−il.
— C’est une revanche, capitaine, répondit Ned Land. Je vous devais cela.
»
Un pâle sourire glissa sur les lèvres du capitaine, et ce fut tout.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 272
« Au Nautilus », dit−il.
L’embarcation vola sur les flots. Quelques minutes plus tard, nous
rencontrions le cadavre du requin qui flottait.
A la couleur noire marquant l’extrémité de ses nageoires, je reconnus le
terrible mélanoptère de la mer des Indes, de l’espèce des requins
proprement dits. Sa longueur dépassait vingt−cinq pieds ; sa bouche
énorme occupait le tiers de son corps. C’était un adulte, ce qui se voyait
aux six rangées de dents, disposées en triangles isocèles sur la mâchoire
supérieure.
Conseil le regardait avec un intérêt tout scientifique, et je suis sûr qu’il le
rangeait, non sans raison, dans la classe des cartilagineux. ordre des
chondroptérygiens à branchies fixes, famille des sélaciens, genre des
squales.
Pendant que je considérais cette masse inerte, une douzaine de ces voraces
mélanoptères apparut tout d’un coup autour de l’embarcation ; mais, sans
se préoccuper de nous, ils se jetèrent sur le cadavre et s’en disputèrent les
lambeaux.
A huit heures et demie, nous étions de retour à bord du Nautilus.
Là, je me pris à réfléchir sur les incidents de notre excursion au banc de
Manaar. Deux observations s’en dégageaient inévitablement. L’une,
portant sur l’audace sans pareille du capitaine Nemo, l’autre sur son
dévouement pour un être humain, l’un des représentants de cette race qu’il
fuyait sous les mers. Quoi qu’il en dît, cet homme étrange n’était pas
parvenu encore à tuer son coeur tout entier.
Lorsque je lui fis cette observation, il me répondit d’un ton légèrement
ému :
« Cet Indien, monsieur le professeur, c’est un habitant du pays des
opprimés, et je suis encore, et, jusqu’à mon dernier souffle, je serai de ce
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 273
pays−là ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une perle de dix millions 274
La mer rouge
Pendant la journée du 29 janvier, l’île de Ceylan disparut sous l’horizon, et
le Nautilus, avec une vitesse de vingt milles à l’heure, se glissa dans ce
labyrinthe de canaux qui séparent les Maledives des Laquedives. Il rangea
même l’île Kittan, terre d’origine madréporique, découverte par Vasco de
Gama en 1499, et l’une des dix−neuf principales îles de cet archipel des
Laquedives, situé entre 10° et 14°30’de latitude nord, et 69° et 50°72’de
longitude est.
Nous avions fait alors seize mille deux cent vingt milles, ou sept mille cinq
cents lieues depuis notre point de départ dans les mers du Japon.
Le lendemain 30 janvier – lorsque le Nautilus remonta à la surface de
l’Océan, il n’avait plus aucune terre en vue. Il faisait route au
nord−nord−ouest, et se dirigeait vers cette mer d’Oman, creusée entre
l’Arabie et la péninsule indienne, qui sert de débouché au golfe Persique.
C’était évidemment une impasse, sans issue possible. Où nous conduisait
donc le capitaine Nemo ? Je n’aurais pu le dire. Ce qui ne satisfit pas le
Canadien, qui, ce jour−là, me demanda où nous allions.
« Nous allons, maître Ned, où nous conduit la fantaisie du
capitaine.
— Cette fantaisie, répondit le Canadien, ne peut nous mener loin. Le golfe
Persique n’a pas d’issue, et si nous y entrons, nous ne tarderons guère à
revenir sur nos pas.
— Eh bien ! nous reviendrons, maître Land, et si après le golfe Persique, le
Nautilus veut visiter la mer Rouge, le détroit de Babel−Mandeb est
toujours là pour lui livrer passage.
La mer rouge 275
— Je ne vous apprendrai pas, monsieur, répondit Ned Land, que la mer
Rouge est non moins fermée que le golfe, puisque l’isthme de Suez n’est
pas encore percé, et, le fût−il, un bateau mystérieux comme le nôtre ne se
hasarderait pas dans ses canaux coupés d’écluses. Donc, la mer Rouge
n’est pas encore le chemin qui nous ramènera en Europe.
— Aussi, n’ai−je pas dit que nous reviendrions en Europe.
— Que supposez−vous donc ?
— Je suppose qu’après avoir visité ces curieux parages de l’Arabie et de
l’Égypte, le Nautilus redescendra l’Océan indien, peut−être à travers le
canal de Mozambique, peut−être au large des Mascareignes, de manière à
gagner le cap de Bonne−Espérance.
Et une fois au cap de Bonne−Espérance ? demanda le Canadien avec une
insistance toute particulière.
— Eh bien, nous pénétrerons dans cet Atlantique que nous ne connaissons
pas encore. Ah ça ! ami Ned, vous vous fatiguez donc de ce voyage sous
les mers ? Vous vous blasez donc sur le spectacle incessamment varié des
merveilles sous−marines ? Pour mon compte, je verrai avec un extrême
dépit finir ce voyage qu’il aura été donné à si peu d’hommes de faire.
— Mais savez−vous, monsieur Aronnax, répondit le Canadien, que voilà
bientôt trois mois que nous sommes emprisonnés à bord de ce Nautilus ?
— Non, Ned, je ne le sais pas, je ne veux pas le savoir, et je ne compte ni
les jours, ni les heures.
— Mais la conclusion ?
— La conclusion viendra en son temps. D’ailleurs, nous n’y pouvons rien,
et nous discutons inutilement. Si vous veniez me dire, mon brave Ned : «
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 276
Une chance d’évasion nous est offerte », je la discuterais avec vous. Mais
tel n’est pas le cas et, à vous parler franchement, je ne crois pas que le
capitaine Nemo s’aventure jamais dans les mers européennes. »
Par ce court dialogue, on verra que, fanatique du Nautilus, j’étais incarné
dans la peau de son commandant.
Quant à Ned Land, il termina la conversation par ces mots, en forme de
monologue : « Tout cela est bel et bon, mais, à mon avis, où il y a de la
gêne, il n’y a plus de plaisir. »
Pendant quatre jours, jusqu’au 3 février, le Nautilus visita la mer d’Oman,
sous diverses vitesses et à diverses profondeurs. Il semblait marcher au
hasard, comme s’il eût hésité sur la route à suivre, mais il ne dépassa
jamais le tropique du Cancer.
En quittant cette mer, nous eûmes un instant connaissance de Mascate, la
plus importante ville du pays d’Oman. J’admirai son aspect étrange, au
milieu des noirs rochers qui l’entourent et sur lesquels se détachent en
blanc ses maisons et ses forts. J’aperçus le dôme arrondi de ses mosquées,
la pointe élégante de ses minarets, ses fraîches et verdoyantes terrasses.
Mais ce ne fut qu’une vision, et le Nautilus s’enfonça bientôt sous les flots
sombres de ces parages.
Puis, il prolongea à une distance de six milles les côtes arabiques du
Mahrah et de l’Hadramant, et sa ligne ondulée de montagnes, relevée de
quelques ruines anciennes. Le 5 février, nous donnions enfin dans le golfe
d’Aden, véritable entonnoir introduit dans ce goulot de Babel−Mandeb,
qui entonne les eaux indiennes dans la mer Rouge.
Le 6 février, le Nautilus flottait en vue d’Aden, perché sur un promontoire
qu’un isthme étroit réunit au continent, sorte de Gibraltar inaccessible,
dont les Anglais ont refait les
fortifications, après s’en être emparés en 1839. J’entrevis les minarets
octogones de cette ville qui fut autrefois l’entrepôt le plus riche et le plus
commerçant de la côte, au dire de l’historien Edrisi.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 277
Je croyais bien que le capitaine Nemo, parvenu à ce point, allait revenir
en arrière ; mais je me trompais, et, à ma grande surprise, il n’en fut rien.
Le lendemain, 7 février, nous embouquions le détroit de Babel−Mandeb,
dont le nom veut dire en langue arabe : « la porte des Larmes ». Sur vingt
milles de large, il ne compte que cinquante−deux kilomètres de long, et
pour le Nautilus lancé à toute vitesse, le franchir fut l’affaire d’une heure
à peine. Mais je ne vis rien, pas même cette île de Périm, dont le
gouvernement britannique a fortifié la position d’Aden. Trop de steamers
anglais ou français des lignes de Suze à Bombay, à Calcutta, à Melbourne,
à Bourbon, à Maurice, sillonnaient cet étroit passage, pour que le Nautilus
tentât de s’y montrer. Aussi se tint−il prudemment entre deux eaux.
Enfin, à midi, nous sillonnions les flots de la mer Rouge.
La mer Rouge, lac célèbre des traditions bibliques, que les pluies ne
rafraîchissent guère, qu’aucun fleuve important n’arrose, qu’une excessive
évaporation pompe incessamment et qui perd chaque année une tranche
liquide haute d’un mètre et demi ! Singulier golfe, qui, fermé et dans les
conditions d’un lac, serait peut−être entièrement desséché ; inférieur en
ceci à ses voisines la Caspienne ou l’Asphaltite, dont le niveau a seulement
baissé jusqu’au point où leur évaporation a précisément égalé la somme
des eaux reçues dans leur sein.
Cette mer Rouge a deux mille six cents kilomètres de longueur sur une
largeur moyenne de deux cent quarante. Au temps des Ptolémées et des
empereurs romains, elle fut la grande artère commerciale du monde, et le
percement de l’isthme lui rendra cette antique importance que les railways
de Suez ont déjà ramenée en partie.
Je ne voulus même pas chercher à comprendre ce caprice du capitaine
Nemo qui pouvait le décider à nous entraîner dans ce golfe. Mais
j’approuvai sans réserve le Nautilus d’y être entré. Il prit une allure
moyenne, tantôt se tenant à la surface, tantôt plongeant pour éviter
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 278
quelque navire, et je pus observer ainsi le dedans et le dessus de cette mer
si curieuse.
Le 8 février, dès les premières heures du jour, Moka nous apparut, ville
maintenant ruinée, dont les murailles tombent au seul bruit du canon, et
qu’abritent çà et là quelques dattiers verdoyants. Cité importante,
autrefois, qui renfermait six marchés publics, vingt−six mosquées, et à
laquelle ses murs, défendus par quatorze forts, faisaient une ceinture de
trois kilomètres.
Puis, le Nautilus se rapprocha des rivages africains où la profondeur de la
mer est plus considérable. Là, entre deux eaux d’une limpidité de cristal,
par les panneaux ouverts, il nous permit de contempler d’admirables
buissons de coraux
éclatants, et de vastes pans de rochers revêtus d’une splendide fourrure
verte d’algues et de fucus. Quel indescriptible spectacle, et quelle variété
de sites et de paysages à l’arasement de ces écueils et de ces îlots
volcaniques qui confinent à la côte Iybienne ! Mais où ces arborisations
apparurent dans toute leur beauté, ce fut vers les rives orientales que le
Nautilus ne tarda pas à rallier. Ce fut sur les côtes du Téhama, car alors
non seulement ces étalages de zoophytes fleurissaient au−dessous du
niveau de la mer, mais ils formaient aussi des entrelacements pittoresques
qui se déroulaient à dix brasses au−dessus ; ceux−ci plus capricieux, mais
moins colorés que ceux−là dont l’humide vitalité des eaux entretenait la
fraîcheur.
Que d’heures charmantes je passai ainsi à la vitre du salon ! Que
d’échantillons nouveaux de la flore et de la faune sous−marine j’admirai
sous l’éclat de notre fanal électrique ! Des fongies agariciformes, des
actinies de couleur ardoisée, entre autres le thalassianthus aster des
tubipores disposés comme des flûtes et n’attendant que le souffle du dieu
Pan, des coquilles particulières à cette mer, qui s’établissent dans les
excavations madréporiques et dont la base est contournée en courte
spirale, et enfin mille spécimens d’un polypier que je n’avais pas observé
encore, la vulgaire éponge.
La classe des spongiaires, première du groupe des polypes, a été
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 279
précisément créée par ce curieux produit dont l’utilité est incontestable.
L’éponge n’est point un végétal comme l’admettent encore quelques
naturalistes, mais un animal du dernier ordre, un polypier inférieur à celui
du corail. Son animalité n’est pas douteuse, et on ne peut même adopter
l’opinion des anciens qui la regardaient comme un être intermédiaire
entre la plante et l’animal. Je dois dire cependant, que les naturalistes ne
sont pas d’accord sur le mode d’organisation de l’éponge. Pour les uns,
c’est un polypier, et pour d’autres tels que M. Milne Edwards, c’est un
individu isolé et unique.
La classe des spongiaires contient environ trois cents espèces qui se
rencontrent dans un grand nombre de mers, et même dans certains cours
d’eau où elles ont reçu le nom de « fluviatiles ». Mais leurs eaux de
prédilection sont celles de la Méditerranée, de l’archipel grec, de la côte
de Syrie et de la mer Rouge. Là se reproduisent et se développent ces
éponges fines−douces dont la valeur s’élève jusqu’à cent cinquante francs,
l’éponge blonde de Syrie, l’éponge dure de Barbarie, etc. Mais puisque je
ne pouvais espérer d’étudier ces zoophytes dans les échelles du Levant,
dont nous étions séparés par l’infranchissable isthme de Suez, je me
contentai de les observer dans les eaux de la mer Rouge.
J’appelai donc Conseil près de moi, pendant que le Nautilus, par une
profondeur moyenne de huit à neuf mètres, rasait lentement tous ces beaux
rochers de la côte orientale.
Là croissaient des éponges de toutes formes, des éponges pédiculées,
foliacées, globuleuses, digitées. Elles justifiaient assez exactement ces
noms de corbeilles, de calices, de quenouilles, de cornes d’élan, de pied de
lion, de queue de paon, de gant de Neptune, que leur ont attribués les
pêcheurs, plus poètes que les savants. De leur tissu fibreux, enduit d’une
substance gélatineuse a demi fluide, s’échappaient incessamment de petits
filets d’eau, qui après avoir porté la vie dans chaque cellule, en étaient
expulsés par un mouvement contractile. Cette substance disparaît après la
mort du polype, et se putréfie en dégageant de l’ammoniaque. Il ne reste
plus alors que ces fibres cornées ou gélatineuses dont se compose l’éponge
domestique, qui prend une teinte roussâtre, et qui s’emploie à des usages
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 280
divers, selon son degré d’élasticité, de perméabilité ou de résistance à la
macération.
Ces polypiers adhéraient aux rochers, aux coquilles des mollusques et
même aux tiges d’hydrophytes. Ils garnissaient les plus petites
anfractuosités, les uns s’étalant, les autres se dressant ou pendant comme
des excroissances coralligènes. J’appris à Conseil que ces éponges se
pêchaient de deux manières, soit à la drague, soit à la main. Cette dernière
méthode qui nécessite l’emploi des plongeurs, est préférable, car en
respectant le tissu du polypier, elle lui laisse une valeur très supérieure.
Les autres zoophytes qui pullulaient auprès des spongiaires, consistaient
principalement en méduses d’une espèce très élégante ; les mollusques
étaient représentés par des variétés de calmars, qui, d’après d’Orbigny,
sont spéciales à la mer Rouge, et les reptiles par des tortues virgata,
appartenant au genre des chélonées, qui fournirent à notre table un mets
sain et délicat.
Quant aux poissons, ils étaient nombreux et souvent remarquables. Voici
ceux que les filets du Nautilus apportaient plus fréquemment à bord : des
raies, parmi lesquelles les limmes de forme ovale, de couleur brique, au
corps semé d’inégales taches bleues et reconnaissables à leur double
aiguillon dentelé, des arnacks au dos argenté, des pastenaques à la queue
pointillée, et des bockats, vastes manteaux longs de deux mètres qui
ondulaient entre les eaux, des aodons, absolument dépourvus de dents,
sortes de cartilagineux qui se rapprochent du squale, des
ostracions−dromadaires dont la bosse se termine par un aiguillon
recourbé, long d’un pied et demi, des ophidies, véritables murènes à la
queue argentée, au dos bleuâtre, aux pectorales brunes bordées d’un liséré
gris, des fiatoles, espèces de stromatées, zébrés d’étroites raies d’or et
parés des trois couleurs de la France, des blémies−garamits, longs de
quatre décimètres, de superbes caranx, décorés de sept bandes
transversales d’un beau noir, de nageoires bleues et jaunes, et d’écailles
d’or et d’argent, des centropodes, des mulles auriflammes à tête jaune, des
scares, des labres, des balistes, des gobies, etc. , et mille autres poissons
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 281
communs aux Océans que nous avions déjà traversés.
Le 9 février, le Nautilus flottait dans cette partie la plus large de la mer
Rouge, qui est comprise entre Souakin sur la côte ouest et Quonfodah sur
la côte est, sur un diamètre de cent quatre−vingt−dix milles.
Ce jour−là à midi, après le point, le capitaine Nemo monta sur la
plate−forme où je me trouvai. Je me promis de ne point le laisser
redescendre sans l’avoir au moins pressenti sur ses projets ultérieurs. Il
vint à moi dès qu’il m’aperçut, m’offrit gracieusement un cigare et me dit :
« Eh bien ! monsieur le professeur, cette mer Rouge vous plaît−elle ?
Avez−vous suffisamment observé les merveilles qu’elle recouvre, ses
poissons et ses zoophytes, ses parterres d’éponges et ses forêts de corail ?
Avez−vous entrevu les villes jetées sur ses bords ?
— Oui, capitaine Nemo, répondis−je, et le Nautilus s’est merveilleusement
prêté à toute cette étude. Ah ! c’est un intelligent bateau !
— Oui, monsieur, intelligent, audacieux et invulnérable ! Il ne redoute ni
les terribles tempêtes de la mer Rouge, ni ses courants, ni ses écueils.
— En effet, dis−je, cette mer est citée entre les plus mauvaises, et si je ne
me trompe, au temps des Anciens, sa renommée était détestable.
— Détestable, monsieur Aronnax. Les historiens grecs et latins n’en
parlent pas à son avantage, et Strabon dit qu’elle est particulièrement dure
à l’époque des vents Etésiens et de la saison des pluies. L’Arabe Edrisi qui
la dépeint sous le nom de golfe de Colzoum raconte que les navires
périssaient en grand nombre sur ses bancs de sable, et que personne ne se
hasardait à y naviguer la nuit. C’est, prétend−il, une mer sujette à
d’affreux ouragans, semée d’îles inhospitalières, et « qui n’offre rien de
bon » ni dans ses profondeurs, ni à sa surface. En effet, telle est l’opinion
qui se trouve dans Arrien, Agatharchide et Artémidore.
— On voit bien, répliquai−je, que ces historiens n’ont pas navigué à bord
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 282
du Nautilus.
— En effet, répondit en souriant le capitaine, et sous ce rapport, les
modernes ne sont pas plus avancés que les anciens. Il a fallu bien des
siècles pour trouver la puissance mécanique de la vapeur ! Qui sait si dans
cent ans, on verra un second Nautilus ! Les progrès sont lents, monsieur
Aronnax.
— C’est vrai, répondis−je, votre navire avance d’un siècle, de plusieurs
peut−être, sur son époque. Quel malheur qu’un secret pareil doive mourir
avec son inventeur ! »
Le capitaine Nemo ne me répondit pas. Après quelques minutes de
silence :
« Vous me parliez, dit−il, de l’opinion des anciens historiens sur les
dangers qu’offre la navigation de la mer Rouge ?
— C’est vrai, répondis−je, mais leurs craintes n’étaient−elles pas
exagérées ?
— Oui et non, monsieur Aronnax, me répondit le capitaine Nemo, qui me
parut posséder à fond « sa mer Rouge ». Ce qui n’est plus dangereux pour
un navire moderne, bien gréé, solidement construit, maître de sa direction
grâce à l’obéissante vapeur, offrait des périls de toutes sortes aux
bâtiments des anciens. Il faut se représenter ces premiers navigateurs
s’aventurant sur des barques faites de planches cousues avec des cordes
de palmier, calfatées de résine pilée et enduites de graisse de chiens de
mer. Ils n’avaient pas même d’instruments pour relever leur direction, et
ils marchaient à l’estime au milieu de courants qu’ils connaissaient à
peine. Dans ces conditions, les naufrages étaient et devaient être
nombreux. Mais de notre temps, les steamers qui font le service entre Suez
et les mers du Sud n’ont plus rien à redouter des colères de ce golfe, en
dépit des moussons contraires. Leurs capitaines et leurs passagers ne se
préparent pas au départ par des sacrifices propitiatoires, et, au retour, ils
ne vont plus, ornés de guirlandes et de bandelettes dorées, remercier les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 283
dieux dans le temple voisin.
— J’en conviens, dis−je, et la vapeur me paraît avoir tué la
reconnaissance dans le coeur des marins. Mais capitaine, puisque vous
semblez avoir spécialement étudié cette mer, pouvez−vous m’apprendre
quelle est l’origine de son nom ?
— Il existe, monsieur Aronnax, de nombreuses explications à ce sujet.
Voulez−vous connaître l’opinion d’un chroniqueur du XIVe siècle ?
— Volontiers.
— Ce fantaisiste prétend que son nom lui fut donné après le passage des
Israélites, lorsque le Pharaon eut péri dans les flots qui se refermèrent à la
voix de Moïse :
En signe de cette merveille,
Devint la mer rouge et vermeille.
Non puis ne surent la nommer
Autrement que la rouge mer.
— Explication de poète, capitaine Nemo, répondis−je, mais je ne saurais
m’en contenter. Je vous demanderai donc votre opinion personnelle.
— La voici. Suivant moi, monsieur Aronnax, il faut voir dans cette
appellation de mer Rouge une traduction du mot hébreu « Edrom », et si
les anciens lui donnèrent ce nom, ce fut à cause de la coloration
particulière de ses eaux.
— Jusqu’ici cependant je n’ai vu que des flots limpides et sans aucune
teinte particulière.
— Sans doute, mais en avançant vers le fond du golfe, vous remarquerez
cette singulière apparence. Je me rappelle avoir vu la baie de Tor
entièrement rouge, comme un lac de sang.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 284
— Et cette couleur, vous l’attribuez à la présence d’une algue
microscopique ?
— Oui. C’est une matière mucilagineuse pourpre produite par ces chétives
plantules connues sous le nom de trichodesmies, et dont il faut quarante
mille pour occuper l’espace d’un millimètre carré. Peut−être en
rencontrerez−vous, quand nous serons à Tor.
— Ainsi. capitaine Nemo, ce n’est pas la première fois que vous parcourez
la mer Rouge à bord du Nautilus ?
— Non, monsieur.
— Alors, puisque vous parliez plus haut du passage des Israélites et de la
catastrophe des Égyptiens, je vous demanderai si vous avez reconnu sous
les eaux des traces de ce grand fait historique ?
— Non, monsieur le professeur, et cela pour une excellente raison.
— Laquelle ?
— C’est que l’endroit même où Moïse a passé avec tout son peuple est
tellement ensablé maintenant que les chameaux y peuvent à peine baigner
leurs jambes. Vous comprenez que mon Nautilus n’aurait pas assez d’eau
pour lui.
— Et cet endroit ? ... demandai−je.
— Cet endroit est situé un peu au−dessus de Suez, dans ce bras qui
formait autrefois un profond estuaire, alors que la mer Rouge s’étendait
jusqu’aux lacs amers. Maintenant, que ce passage soit miraculeux ou non,
les Israélites n’en ont pas moins passé là pour gagner la Terre promise, et
l’armée de Pharaon a précisément péri en cet endroit. Je pense donc que
des fouilles pratiquées au milieu de ces sables mettraient à découvert une
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 285
grande quantité d’armes et d’instruments d’origine égyptienne.
— C’est évident, répondis−je, et il faut espérer pour les archéologues que
ces fouilles se feront tôt ou tard, lorsque des villes nouvelles s’établiront
sur cet isthme, après le percement du canal de Suez. Un canal bien inutile
pour un navire tel que le Nautilus !
— Sans doute, mais utile au monde entier, dit le capitaine Nemo. Les
anciens avaient bien compris cette utilité pour leurs affaires commerciales
d’établir une communication entre la mer Rouge et la Méditerranée ; mais
ils ne songèrent point à creuser un canal direct, et ils prirent le Nil pour
intermédiaire. Très probablement, le canal qui réunissait le Nil à la mer
Rouge fut commencé sous Sésostris, si l’on en croit la tradition. Ce qui est
certain, c’est que, six cent quinze ans avant Jésus−Christ, Necos entreprit
les travaux d’un canal alimenté par les eaux du Nil, à travers la plaine
d’Égypte qui regarde l’Arabie. Ce canal se remontait en quatre jours, et sa
largeur était telle que deux trirèmes pouvaient y passer de front. Il fut
continué par Darius, fils d’Hytaspe. et probablement achevé par Ptolémée
II. Strabon le vit employé à la navigation ; mais la faiblesse de sa pente
entre son point de départ, près de Bubaste, et la mer Rouge, ne le rendait
navigable que pendant quelques mois de l’année. Ce canal servit au
commerce jusqu’au siècle des Antonins ; abandonné, ensablé, puis rétabli
par les ordres du calife Omar, il fut définitivement comblé en 761 ou 762
par le calife Al−Mansor, qui voulut empêcher les vivres d’arriver à
Mohammed−ben− Abdoallah, révolté contre lui. Pendant l’expédition
d’Égypte, votre général Bonaparte retrouva les traces de ces travaux dans
le désert de Suez, et, surpris par la marée. il faillit périr quelques heures
avant de rejoindre Hadjaroth, là même où Moïse avait campé trois mille
trois cents ans avant lui.
— Eh bien, capitaine, ce que les anciens n’avaient osé entreprendre, cette
jonction entre les deux mers qui abrégera de neuf mille kilomètres la route
de Cadix aux Indes, M. de Lesseps l’a fait, et avant peu, il aura changé
l’Afrique en une île immense.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 286
— Oui, monsieur Aronnax, et vous avez le droit d’être fier de votre
compatriote. C’est un homme qui honore plus une nation que les plus
grands capitaines ! Il a commencé comme tant d’autres par les ennuis et
les rebuts, mais il a triomphé, car il a le génie de la volonté. Et il est triste
de penser que cette oeuvre, qui aurait dû être une oeuvre internationale,
qui aurait suffi à illustrer un règne, n’aura réussi que par l’énergie d’un
seul homme. Donc, honneur à M. de Lesseps !
— Oui, honneur à ce grand citoyen, répondis−je, tout surpris de l’accent
avec lequel le capitaine Nemo venait de parler.
— Malheureusement, reprit−il, je ne puis vous conduire à travers ce canal
de Suez, mais vous pourrez apercevoir les longues jetées de Port−Saïd
après−demain, quand nous serons dans la Méditerranée.
— Dans la Méditerranée ! m’écriai−je.
— Oui. monsieur le professeur. Cela vous étonne ?
— Ce qui m’étonne, c’est de penser que nous y serons après−demain.
— Vraiment ?
— Oui, capitaine, bien que je dusse être habitué à ne m’étonner de rien
depuis que je suis à votre bord !
— Mais à quel propos cette surprise ?
— A propos de l’effroyable vitesse que vous serez forcé d’imprimer au
Nautilus s’il doit se retrouver après−demain en pleine Méditerranée,
ayant fait le tour de l’Afrique et doublé le cap de Bonne−Espérance !
— Et qui vous dit qu’il fera le tour de l’Afrique, monsieur le professeur ?
Qui vous parle de doubler le cap de Bonne−Espérance !
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 287
— Cependant, à moins que le Nautilus ne navigue en terre ferme et qu’il
ne passe par−dessus l’isthme...
— Ou par−dessous, monsieur Aronnax.
— Par−dessous ?
— Sans doute, répondit tranquillement le capitaine Nemo. Depuis
longtemps la nature a fait sous cette langue de terre ce que les hommes
font aujourd’hui à sa surface.
— Quoi ! il existerait un passage !
— Oui, un passage souterrain que j’ai nommé Arabian−Tunnel. Il prend
au−dessous de Suez et aboutit au golfe de Péluse.
— Mais cet isthme n’est composé que de sables mouvants ?
— Jusqu’à une certaine profondeur. Mais à cinquante mètres seulement se
rencontre une inébranlable assise de roc.
— Et c’est par hasard que vous avez découvert ce passage ? demandai−je
de plus en plus surpris.
— Hasard et raisonnement, monsieur le professeur, et même,
raisonnement plus que hasard.
— Capitaine, je vous écoute, mais mon oreille résiste à ce qu’elle entend.
— Ah monsieur ! Aures habent et non audient est de tous les temps. Non
seulement ce passage existe, mais j’en ai profité plusieurs fois. Sans cela,
je ne me serais pas aventuré aujourd’hui dans cette impasse de la mer
Rouge.
— Est−il indiscret de vous demander comment vous avez découvert ce
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 288
tunnel ?
— Monsieur, me répondit le capitaine, il n’y peut y avoir rien de secret
entre gens qui ne doivent plus se quitter. » Je ne relevai pas l’insinuation
et j’attendis le récit du capitaine Nemo. « Monsieur le professeur, me
dit−il, c’est un simple raisonnement de naturaliste qui m’a conduit a
découvrir ce passage que je suis seul à connaître. J’avais remarqué que
dans la mer Rouge et dans la Méditerranée, il existait un certain nombre
de poissons d’espèces absolument identiques, des ophidies, des fiatoles,
des girelles, des persègues, des joels, des exocets. Certain de ce fait je me
demandai s’il n’existait pas de communication entre les deux mers. Si elle
existait, le courant souterrain devait forcément aller de la mer Rouge à la
Méditerranée par le seul effet de la différence des niveaux. Je pêchai donc
un grand nombre de poissons aux environs de Suez. Je leur passai à la
queue un anneau de cuivre, et je les rejetai à la mer. Quelques mois plus
tard, sur les côtes de Syrie, je reprenais quelques échantillons de mes
poissons ornés de leur anneau indicateur. La communication entre les
deux m’était donc démontrée. Je la cherchai avec mon Nautilus, je la
découvris, je m’y aventurai, et avant peu, monsieur le professeur, vous
aussi vous aurez franchi mon tunnel arabique ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer rouge 289
Arabian−tunnel
Ce jour même, je rapportai à Conseil et à Ned Land la partie de cette
conversation qui les intéressait directement. Lorsque je leur appris que,
dans deux jours, nous serions au milieu des eaux de la Méditerranée,
Conseil battit des mains, mais le Canadien haussa les épaules.
« Un tunnel sous−marin ! s’écria−t−il, une communication entre les deux
mers ! Qui a jamais entendu parler de cela ?
— Ami Ned, répondit Conseil, aviez−vous jamais entendu parler du
Nautilus ? Non ! il existe cependant. Donc, ne haussez pas les épaules si
légèrement, et ne repoussez pas les choses sous prétexte que vous n’en
avez Jamais entendu parler.
— Nous verrons bien ! riposta Ned Land, en secouant la tête. Après tout, je
ne demande pas mieux que de croire à son passage, à ce capitaine, et fasse
le ciel qu’il nous conduise, en effet, dans la Méditerranée. »
Le soir même, par 21°30’de latitude nord, le Nautilus, flottant à la surface
de la mer, se rapprocha de la côte arabe. J’aperçus Djeddah, important
comptoir de l’Égypte, de la Syrie, de la Turquie et des Indes. Je distinguai
assez nettement l’ensemble de ses constructions, les navires amarrés le
long des quais, et ceux que leur tirant d’eau obligeait à mouiller en rade.
Le soleil, assez bas sur l’horizon, frappait en plein les maisons de la ville
et faisait ressortir leur blancheur. En dehors, quelques cabanes de bois ou
de roseaux indiquaient le quartier habité par les Bédouins.
Bientôt Djeddah s’effaça dans les ombres du soir, et le Nautilus rentra
sous les eaux légèrement phosphorescentes.
Le lendemain, 10 février, plusieurs navires apparurent qui couraient à
Arabian−tunnel 290
contre−bord de nous. Le Nautilus reprit sa navigation sous−marine ; mais
à midi, au moment du point, la mer étant déserte, il remonta jusqu’à sa
ligne de flottaison.
Accompagné de Ned et de Conseil, je vins m’asseoir sur la plate−forme.
La côte à l’est se montrait comme une masse à peine estompée dans un
humide brouillard.
Appuyés sur les flancs du canot, nous causions de choses et d’autres,
quand Ned Land tendant sa main vers un point de la mer, me dit :
« Voyez−vous là quelque chose, monsieur le professeur ?
— Non, Ned, répondis−je, mais je n’ai pas vos yeux, vous le savez.
— Regardez bien, reprit Ned, là, par tribord devant, à peu près à la
hauteur du fanal ! Vous ne voyez pas une masse qui semble remuer ?
— En effet, dis−je, après une attentive observation, j’aperçois comme un
long corps noirâtre à la surface des eaux.
— Un autre Nautilus ? dit Conseil.
— Non, répondit le Canadien, mais je me trompe fort, ou c’est là quelque
animal marin.
— Y a−t−il des baleines dans la mer Rouge ? demanda Conseil.
— Oui, mon garçon, répondis−je, on en rencontre quelquefois.
— Ce n’est point une baleine, reprit Ned Land, qui ne perdait pas des yeux
l’objet signalé. Les baleines et moi, nous sommes de vieilles
connaissances, et je ne me tromperais pas à leur allure.
— Attendons, dit Conseil. Le Nautilus se dirige de ce côté, et avant peu
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 291
nous saurons à quoi nous en tenir. »
En effet, cet objet noirâtre ne fut bientôt qu’à un mille de nous. Il
ressemblait à un gros écueil échoué en pleine mer. Qu’était−ce ? Je ne
pouvais encore me prononcer.
« Ah ! il marche ! il plonge ! s’écria Ned Land. Mille diables ! Quel peut
être cet animal ? Il n’a pas la queue bifurquée comme les baleines ou les
cachalots, et ses nageoires ressemblent à des membres tronqués.
— Mais alors.... , fis−je.
— Bon, reprit le Canadien, le voilà sur le dos, et il dresse ses mamelles en
l’air !
— C’est une sirène, s’écria Conseil, une véritable sirène, n’en déplaise à
monsieur. »
Ce nom de sirène me mit sur la voie, et je compris que cet animal
appartenait à cet ordre d’êtres marins, dont la fable a fait les sirènes,
moitié femmes et moitié poissons.
« Non, dis−je à Conseil, ce n’est point une sirène, mais un être curieux
dont il reste à peine quelques échantillons dans la mer Rouge. C’est un
dugong.
— Ordre des syréniens, groupe des pisciformes, sous−classe des
monodelphiens, classe des mammifères, embranchement des vertébrés »,
répondit Conseil.
Et lorsque Conseil avait ainsi parlé, il n’y avait plus rien à dire.
Cependant Ned Land regardait toujours. Ses yeux brillaient de convoitise
à la vue de cet animal. Sa main semblait prête à le harponner. On eût dit
qu’il attendait le moment de se jeter à la mer pour l’attaquer dans son
élément.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 292
« Oh ! monsieur, me dit−il d’une voix tremblante d’émotion, je n’ai jamais
tué de » cela ».
Tout le harponneur était dans ce mot.
En cet instant, le capitaine Nemo parut sur la plateforme. Il aperçut le
dugong. Il comprit l’attitude du Canadien, et s’adressant directement à
lui :
« Si vous teniez un harpon, maître Land, est−ce qu’il ne vous brûlerait pas
la main ?
— Comme vous dites, monsieur.
— Et il ne vous déplairait pas de reprendre pour un jour votre métier de
pêcheur, et d’ajouter ce cétacé à la liste de ceux que vous avez déjà
frappés ?
— Cela ne me déplairait point.
— Eh bien, vous pouvez essayer.
— Merci, monsieur, répondit Ned Land dont les yeux s’enflammèrent.
— Seulement, reprit le capitaine, je vous engage à ne pas manquer cet
animal, et cela dans votre intérêt.
— Est−ce que ce dugong est dangereux à attaquer ? demandai−je malgré
le haussement d’épaule du Canadien.
— Oui, quelquefois, répondit le capitaine. Cet animal revient sur ses
assaillants et chavire leur embarcation. Mais pour maître Land, ce danger
n’est pas à craindre. Son coup d’oeil est prompt, son bras est sûr. Si je lui
recommande de ne pas manquer ce dugong, c’est qu’on le regarde
justement comme un fin gibier, et je sais que maître Land ne déteste pas
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 293
les bons morceaux.
— Ah ! fit le Canadien, cette bête−la se donne aussi le luxe d’être bonne à
manger ?
— Oui, maître Land. Sa chair, une viande véritable, est extrêmement
estimée, et on la réserve dans toute la Malaisie pour la table des princes.
Aussi fait−on à cet excellent animal une chasse tellement acharnée que, de
même que le lamantin, son congénère, il devient de plus en plus rare.
— Alors, monsieur le capitaine, dit sérieusement Conseil, si par hasard
celui−ci était le dernier de sa race, ne conviendrait−il pas de l’épargner
dans l’intérêt de la science ?
— Peut−être, répliqua le Canadien ; mais, dans l’intérêt de la cuisine, il
vaut mieux lui donner la chasse.
— Faites donc, maître Land », répondit le capitaine Nemo.
En ce moment sept hommes de l’équipage, muets et impassibles comme
toujours, montèrent sur la plate−forme. L’un portait un harpon et une
ligne semblable à celles qu’emploient les pêcheurs de baleines. Le canot
fut déponté, arraché de son alvéole, lancé à la mer. Six rameurs prirent
place sur leurs bancs et le patron se mit à la barre. Ned, Conseil et moi,
nous nous assîmes à l’arrière.
« Vous ne venez pas, capitaine ? demandai−je.
— Non, monsieur, mais je vous souhaite une bonne chasse. »
Le canot déborda, et, enlevé par ses six avirons, il se dirigea rapidement
vers le dugong, qui flottait alors à deux milles du Nautilus.
Arrivé à quelques encablures du cétacé, il ralentit sa marche, et les rames
plongèrent sans bruit dans les eaux tranquilles. Ned Land, son harpon à la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 294
main, alla se placer debout sur l’avant du canot. Le harpon qui sert à
frapper la baleine est ordinairement attaché à une très longue corde qui se
dévide rapidement lorsque l’animal blessé l’entraîne avec lui. Mais ici la
corde ne mesurait pas plus d’une dizaine de brasses, et son extrémité était
seulement frappée sur un petit baril qui, en flottant, devait indiquer la
marche du dugong sous les eaux.
Je m’étais levé et j’observais distinctement l’adversaire du Canadien. Ce
dugong, qui porte aussi le nom d’halicore, ressemblait beaucoup au
lamantin. Son corps oblong se terminait par une caudale très allongée et
ses nageoires latérales par de véritables doigts. Sa différence avec le
lamantin consistait en ce que sa mâchoire supérieure était armée de deux
dents longues et pointues, qui formaient de chaque côté des défenses
divergentes.
Ce dugong, que Ned Land se préparait à attaquer, avait des dimensions
colossales, et sa longueur dépassait au moins sept mètres. Il ne bougeait
pas et semblait dormir à la surface des flots, circonstance qui rendait sa
capture plus facile.
Le canot s’approcha prudemment à trois brasses de l’animal. Les avirons
restèrent suspendus sur leurs dames. Je me levai à demi. Ned Land, le
corps un peu rejeté en arrière, brandissait son harpon d’une main exercée.
Soudain, un sifflement se fit entendre, et le dugong disparut. Le harpon,
lancé avec force, n’avait frappé que l’eau sans doute.
« Mille diables ! s’écria le Canadien furieux, je l’ai manqué !
— Non, dis−je, l’animal est blessé, voici son sang, mais votre engin ne lui
est pas resté dans le corps.
— Mon harpon ! mon harpon ! » cria Ned Land.
Les matelots se remirent à nager, et le patron dirigea l’embarcation vers
le baril flottant. Le harpon repêché, le canot se mit à la poursuite de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 295
l’animal.
Celui−ci revenait de temps en temps à la surface de la mer pour respirer.
Sa blessure ne l’avait pas affaibli, car il filait avec une rapidité extrême.
L’embarcation, manoeuvrée par des bras vigoureux, volait sur ses traces.
Plusieurs fois elle l’approcha à quelques brasses, et le Canadien se tenait
prêt à frapper ; mais le dugong se dérobait par un plongeon subit, et il
était impossible de l’atteindre.
On juge de la colère qui surexcitait l’impatient Ned Land. Il lançait au
malheureux animal les plus énergiques jurons de la langue anglaise. Pour
mon compte, je n’en étais encore qu’au dépit de voir le dugong déjouer
toutes nos ruses.
On le poursuivit sans relâche pendant une heure, et je commençais à
croire qu’il serait très difficile de s’en emparer, quand cet animal fut pris
d’une malencontreuse idée de vengeance dont il eut à se repentir. Il revint
sur le canot pour l’assaillir à son tour.
Cette manoeuvre n’échappa point au Canadien.
« Attention ! » dit−il.
Le patron prononça quelques mots de sa langue bizarre, et sans doute il
prévint ses hommes de se tenir sur leurs gardes.
Le dugong, arrivé à vingt pieds du canot, s’arrêta, huma brusquement l’air
avec ses vastes narines percées non à l’extrémité, mais à la partie
supérieure de son museau. Puis, prenant son élan, il se précipita sur nous.
Le canot ne put éviter son choc ; à demi renversé, il embarqua une ou deux
tonnes d’eau qu’il fallut vider ; mais, grâce à l’habileté du patron, abordé
de biais et non de plein, il ne chavira pas. Ned Land, cramponné à
l’étrave, lardait de coups de harpon le gigantesque animal, qui, de ses
dents incrustées dans le plat−bord, soulevait l’embarcation hors de l’eau
comme un lion fait d’un chevreuil. Nous étions renversés les uns sur les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 296
autres, et je ne sais trop comment aurait fini l’aventure, si le Canadien,
toujours acharné contre la bête, ne l’eût enfin frappée au coeur.
J’entendis le grincement des dents sur la tôle, et le dugong disparut,
entraînant le harpon avec lui. Mais bientôt le baril revint à la surface, et
peu d’instants après, apparut le corps de l’animal, retourné sur le dos. Le
canot le rejoignit, le prit à la remorque et se dirigea vers le Nautilus.
Il fallut employer des palans d’une grande puissance pour hisser le
dugong sur la plate−forme. Il pesait cinq mille kilogrammes. On le dépeça
sous les yeux du Canadien, qui tenait à suivre tous les détails de
l’opération. Le jour même, le stewart me servit au dîner quelques tranches
de cette chair habilement apprêtée par le cuisinier du bord. Je la trouvai
excellente, et même supérieure à celle du veau, sinon du boeuf.
Le lendemain 11 février, l’office du Nautilus s’enrichit encore d’un gibier
délicat. Une compagnie d’hirondelles de mer s’abattit sur le Nautilus.
C’était une espèce de sterna nilotica, particulière à l’Égypte, dont le bec
est noir, la tête grise et pointillée, l’oeil entouré de points blancs, le dos,
les ailes et la queue grisâtres, le ventre et la gorge blancs, les pattes
rouges. On prit aussi quelques douzaines de canards du Nil, oiseaux
sauvages d’un haut goût, dont le cou et le dessus de la tête sont blancs et
tachetés de noir.
La vitesse du Nautilus était alors modérée. Il s’avançait en flânant, pour
ainsi dire. J’observai que l’eau de la mer Rouge devenait de moins en
moins salée, a mesure que nous approchions de Suez.
Vers cinq heures du soir, nous relevions au nord le cap de
Ras−Mohammed. C’est ce cap qui forme l’extrémité de l’Arabie Pétrée,
comprise entre le golfe de Suez et le golfe d’Acabah.
Le Nautilus pénétra dans le détroit de Jubal, qui conduit au golfe de Suez.
J’aperçus distinctement une haute montagne, dominant entre les deux
golfes le Ras− Mohammed. C’était le mont Oreb, ce Sinaï, au sommet
duquel Moïse vit Dieu face à face, et que l’esprit se figure incessamment
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 297
couronné d’éclairs.
A six heures, le Nautilus, tantôt flottant, tantôt immergé, passait au large
de Tor, assise au fond d’une baie dont les eaux paraissaient teintées de
rouge, observation déjà faite par le capitaine Nemo. Puis la nuit se fit, au
milieu d’un lourd silence que rompaient parfois le cri du pélican et de
quelques oiseaux de nuit, le bruit du ressac irrité par les rocs ou le
gémissement lointain d’un steamer battant les eaux du golfe de ses pales
sonores.
De huit à neuf heures, le Nautilus demeura à quelques mètres sous les
eaux. Suivant mon calcul, nous devions être très près de Suez. A travers les
panneaux du salon, j’apercevais des fonds de rochers vivement éclairés
par notre lumière électrique. Il me semblait que le détroit se rétrécissait de
plus en plus.
A neuf heures un quart, le bateau étant revenu à la surface, je montai sur
la plate−forme. Très impatient de franchir le tunnel du capitaine Nemo, je
ne pouvais tenir en place, et je cherchais à respirer l’air frais de la nuit.
Bientôt, dans l’ombre, j’aperçus un feu pâle, à demi décoloré par la
brume, qui brillait à un mille de nous.
« Un phare flottant », dit−on près de moi.
Je me retournai et je reconnus le capitaine.
« C’est le feu flottant de Suez, reprit−il. Nous ne tarderons pas à gagner
l’orifice du tunnel.
— L’entrée n’en doit pas être facile ?
— Non, monsieur. Aussi j’ai pour habitude de me tenir dans la cage du
timonier pour diriger moi−même la manoeuvre. Et maintenant, si vous
voulez descendre, monsieur Aronnax, le Nautilus va s’enfoncer sous les
flots, et il ne reviendra à leur surface qu’après avoir franchi
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 298
l’Arabian−Tunnel. »
Je suivis le capitaine Nemo. Le panneau se ferma, les réservoirs d’eau
s’emplirent, et l’appareil s’immergea d’une dizaine de mètres.
Au moment où me disposais à regagner ma chambre, le capitaine
m’arrêta.
« Monsieur le professeur, me dit−il, vous plairait−il de m’accompagner
dans la cage du pilote ?
— Je n’osais vous le demander, répondis−je.
— Venez donc. Vous verrez ainsi tout ce que l’on peut voir de cette
navigation à la fois sous−terrestre et sous−marine. »
Le capitaine Nemo me conduisit vers l’escalier central. A mi−rampe, il
ouvrit une porte, suivit les coursives supérieures et arriva dans la cage du
pilote, qui, on le sait, s’élevait à l’extrémité de la plate−forme.
C’était une cabine mesurant six pieds sur chaque face, à peu près
semblable à celles qu’occupent les timoniers des steamboats du Mississipi
ou de l’Hudson. Au milieu se manoeuvrait une roue disposée
verticalement, engrenée sur les drosses du gouvernail qui couraient
jusqu’à l’arrière du Nautilus. Quatre hublots de verres lenticulaires,
évidés dans les parois de la cabine, permettaient à l’homme de barre de
regarder dans toutes les directions.
Cette cabine était obscure ; mais bientôt mes yeux s’accoutumèrent à cette
obscurité, et j’aperçus le pilote, un homme vigoureux, dont les mains
s’appuyaient sur les jantes de la roue. Au−dehors, la mer apparaissait
vivement éclairée par le fanal qui rayonnait en arrière de la cabine, à
l’autre extrémité de la plate−forme.
« Maintenant, dit le capitaine Nemo, cherchons notre passage. »
Des fils électriques reliaient la cage du timonier avec la chambre des

machines, et de là, le capitaine pouvait communiquer simultanément à son
Nautilus la direction et le mouvement. Il pressa un bouton de métal, et
aussitôt la vitesse de l’hélice fut très diminuée.
Je regardais en silence la haute muraille très accore que nous longions en
ce moment, inébranlable base du massif sableux de la côte. Nous la
suivîmes ainsi pendant une heure, à quelques mètres de distance
seulement. Le capitaine Nemo ne quittait pas du regard la boussole
suspendue dans la cabine à ses deux cercles concentriques. Sur un simple
geste, le timonier modifiait à chaque instant la direction du Nautilus.
Je m’étais placé au hublot de bâbord, et j’apercevais de magnifiques
substructions de coraux, des zoophytes, des algues et des crustacés agitant
leurs pattes énormes, qui s’allongeaient hors des anfractuosités du roc.
A dix heures un quart, le capitaine Nemo prit lui−même la barre. Une
large galerie, noire et profonde, s’ouvrait devant nous. Le Nautilus s’y
engouffra hardiment. Un bruissement inaccoutumé se fit entendre sur ses
flancs. C’étaient les eaux de la mer Rouge que la pente du tunnel
précipitait vers la Méditerranée. Le Nautilus suivait le torrent, rapide
comme une flèche, malgré les efforts de sa machine qui, pour résister,
battait les flots à contre−hélice.
Sur les murailles étroites du passage, je ne voyais plus que des raies
éclatantes, des lignes droites, des sillons de feu tracés par la vitesse sous
l’éclat de l’électricité. Mon coeur palpitait, et je le comprimais de la main.
A dix heures trente−cinq minutes, le capitaine Nemo abandonna la roue
du gouvernail, et se retournant vers moi :
« La Méditerranée », me dit−il.
En moins de vingt minutes, le Nautilus, entraîné par ce torrent, venait de
franchir l’isthme de Suez.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Arabian−tunnel 300
L'archipel grec
Le lendemain, 12 février, au lever du jour, le Nautilus remonta à la surface
des flots. Je me précipitai sur la plate−forme. A trois milles dans le sud se
dessinait la vague silhouette de Péluse. Un torrent nous avait portés d’une
mer à l’autre. Mais ce tunnel, facile à descendre, devait être impraticable
à remonter.
Vers sept heures, Ned et Conseil me rejoignirent. Ces deux inséparables
compagnons avaient tranquillement dormi, sans se préoccuper autrement
des prouesses du Nautilus.
« Eh bien, monsieur le naturaliste, demanda le Canadien d’un ton
légèrement goguenard, et cette Méditerranée ?
— Nous flottons à sa surface, ami Ned.
— Hein ! fit Conseil, cette nuit même ? ...
— Oui, cette nuit même, en quelques minutes, nous avons franchi cet
isthme infranchissable.
— Je n’en crois rien, répondit le Canadien.
— Et vous avez tort, maître Land, repris−je. Cette côte basse qui
s’arrondit vers le sud est la côte égyptienne.
— A d’autres, monsieur, répliqua l’entêté Canadien.
— Mais puisque monsieur l’affirme, lui dit Conseil, il faut croire monsieur.
— D’ailleurs, Ned, le capitaine Nemo m’a fait les honneurs de son tunnel,
L'archipel grec 301
et j’étais près de lui, dans la cage du timonier, pendant qu’il dirigeait
lui−même le Nautilus à travers cet étroit passage.
— Vous entendez, Ned ? dit Conseil.
— Et vous qui avez de si bons yeux, ajoutai−je, vous pouvez, Ned,
apercevoir les jetées de Port−Saïd qui s’allongent dans la mer. »
Le Canadien regarda attentivement.
« En effet, dit−il, vous avez raison, monsieur le professeur, et votre
capitaine est un maître homme. Nous sommes dans la Méditerranée. Bon.
Causons donc, s’il vous plaît, de nos petites affaires, mais de façon à ce
que personne ne puisse nous entendre. »
Je vis bien où le Canadien voulait en venir. En tout cas, je pensai qu’il
valait mieux causer, puisqu’il le désirait, et tous les trois nous allâmes
nous asseoir près du fanal, où nous étions moins exposés à recevoir
l’humide embrun des lames.
« Maintenant, Ned, nous vous écoutons, dis−je. Qu’avez−vous à nous
apprendre ?
— Ce que j’ai à vous apprendre est très simple, répondit le Canadien.
Nous sommes en Europe, et avant que les caprices du capitaine Nemo
nous entraînent jusqu’au fond des mers polaires ou nous ramènent en
Océanie, je demande à quitter le Nautilus. »
J’avouerai que cette discussion avec le Canadien m’embarrassait
toujours. Je ne voulais en aucune façon entraver la liberté de mes
compagnons, et cependant je n’éprouvais nul désir de quitter le capitaine
Nemo. Grâce à lui, grâce à son appareil, je complétais chaque jour mes
études sous−marines, et je refaisais mon livre des fonds sous−marins au
milieu même de son élément. Retrouverais−je jamais une telle occasion
d’observer les merveilles de l’Océan ? Non, certes ! Je ne pouvais donc me
faire à cette idée d’abandonner le Nautilus avant notre cycle
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 302
d’investigations accompli.
« Ami Ned, dis−je, répondez−moi franchement. Vous ennuyez−vous à
bord ? Regrettez−vous que la destinée vous ait jeté entre les mains du
capitaine Nemo ? »
Le Canadien resta quelques instants sans répondre. Puis, se croisant les
bras :
« Franchement, dit−il, je ne regrette pas ce voyage sous les mers. Je serai
content de l’avoir fait ; mais pour l’avoir fait, il faut qu’il se termine. Voilà
mon sentiment.
— Il se terminera, Ned.
— Où et quand ?
— Où ? je n’en sais rien. Quand ? je ne peux le dire, ou plutôt je suppose
qu’il s’achèvera, lorsque ces mers n’auront plus rien à nous apprendre.
Tout ce qui a commencé a forcément une fin en ce monde.
— Je pense comme monsieur, répondit Conseil, et il est fort possible
qu’après avoir parcouru toutes les mers du globe, le capitaine Nemo nous
donne la volée à tous trois.
— La volée ! s’écria le Canadien. Une volée, voulez−vous dire ?
— N’exagérons pas, maître Land, repris−je. Nous n’avons rien à craindre
du capitaine, mais je ne partage pas non plus les idées de Conseil. Nous
sommes maîtres des secrets du Nautilus, et je n’espère pas que son
commandant, pour nous rendre notre liberté, se résigne à les voir courir le
monde avec nous.
— Mais alors, qu’espérez−vous donc ? demanda le Canadien.
— Que des circonstances se rencontreront dont nous pourrons, dont nous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 303
devrons profiter, aussi bien dans six mois que maintenant.
— Ouais ! fit Ned Land. Et où serons−nous dans six mois, s’il vous plaît,
monsieur le naturaliste ?
— Peut−être ici, peut−être en Chine. Vous le savez, le Nautilus est un
rapide marcheur. Il traverse les océans comme une hirondelle traverse les
airs, ou un express les continents. Il ne craint point les mers fréquentées.
Qui nous dit qu’il ne va pas rallier les côtes de France, d’Angleterre ou
d’Amérique, sur lesquelles une fuite pourra être aussi avantageusement
tentée qu’ici ?
— Monsieur Aronnax, répondit le Canadien, vos arguments pèchent par la
base. Vous parlez au futur : « Nous serons là ! Nous serons ici ! » Moi je
parle au présent : « Nous sommes ici, et il faut en profiter. »
J’étais pressé de près par la logique de Ned Land, et je me sentais battu
sur ce terrain. Je ne savais plus quels arguments faire valoir en ma faveur.
« Monsieur, reprit Ned, supposons, par impossible, que le capitaine Nemo
vous offre aujourd’hui même la liberté. Accepterez−vous ?
— Je ne sais, répondis−je.
— Et s’il ajoute que cette offre qu’il vous fait aujourd’hui, il ne la
renouvellera pas plus tard, accepterez−vous ? »
Je ne répondis pas.
« Et qu’en pense l’ami Conseil ? demanda Ned Land.
— L’ami Conseil, répondit tranquillement ce digne garçon, l’ami Conseil
n’a rien à dire. Il est absolument désintéressé dans la question. Ainsi que
son maître, ainsi que son camarade Ned, il est célibataire. Ni femme, ni
parents, ni enfants ne l’attendent au pays. Il est au service de monsieur, il
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 304
pense comme monsieur, il parle comme monsieur, et, à son grand regret,
on ne doit pas compter sur lui pour faire une majorité. Deux personnes
seulement sont en présence : monsieur d’un côté, Ned Land de l’autre.
Cela dit, l’ami Conseil écoute, et il est prêt à marquer les points. »
Je ne pus m’empêcher de sourire, à voir Conseil annihiler si complètement
sa personnalité. Au fond, le Canadien devait être enchanté de ne pas
l’avoir contre lui.
« Alors, monsieur, dit Ned Land, puisque Conseil n’existe pas, ne
discutons qu’entre nous deux. J’ai parlé, vous m’avez entendu.
Qu’avez−vous à répondre ? »
Il fallait évidemment conclure, et les faux−fuyants me répugnaient.
« Ami Ned, dis−je, voici ma réponse. Vous avez raison contre moi, et mes
arguments ne peuvent tenir devant les vôtres. Il ne faut pas compter sur la
bonne volonté du capitaine Nemo. La prudence la plus vulgaire lui défend
de nous mettre en liberté. Par contre, la prudence veut que nous profitions
de la première occasion de quitter le Nautilus.
— Bien, monsieur Aronnax, voilà qui est sagement parlé.
— Seulement, dis−je, une observation, une seule. Il faut que l’occasion
soit sérieuse. Il faut que notre première tentative de fuite réussisse ; car si
elle avorte, nous ne retrouverons pas l’occasion de la reprendre, et le
capitaine Nemo ne nous pardonnera pas.
— Tout cela est juste, répondit le Canadien. Mais votre observation
s’applique à toute tentative de fuite, qu’elle ait lieu dans deux ans ou dans
deux jours. Donc, la question est toujours celle−ci : si une occasion
favorable se présente, il faut la saisir.
— D’accord. Et maintenant, me direz−vous. Ned, ce que vous entendez
par une occasion favorable ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 305
— Ce serait celle qui. par une nuit sombre, amènerait le Nautilus à peu de
distance d’une côte européenne.
Et vous tenteriez de vous sauver à la nage ?
Oui, si nous étions suffisamment rapprochés d’un rivage, et si le navire
flottait à la surface. Non, si nous étions éloignés, et si le navire naviguait
sous les eaux.
— Et dans ce cas ?
— Dans ce cas, je chercherais à m’emparer du canot. Je sais comment il
se manoeuvre. Nous nous introduirions à l’intérieur, et les boulons
enlevés, nous remonterions à la surface, sans même que le timonier, placé
à l’avant, s’aperçût de notre fuite.
— Bien, Ned. Épiez donc cette occasion ; mais n’oubliez pas qu’un échec
nous perdrait.
— Je ne l’oublierai pas, monsieur.
— Et maintenant, Ned, voulez−vous connaître toute ma pensée sur votre
projet ?
— Volontiers, monsieur Aronnax.
— Eh bien, je pense — je ne dis pas j’espère — je pense que cette occasion
favorable ne se présentera pas.
— Pourquoi cela ?
— Parce que le capitaine Nemo ne peut se dissimuler que nous n’avons
pas renoncé à l’espoir de recouvrer notre liberté, et qu’il se tiendra sur ses
gardes, surtout dans les mers et en vue des côtes européennes.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 306
— Je suis de l’avis de monsieur, dit Conseil.
— Nous verrons bien, répondit Ned Land, qui secouait la tête d’un air
déterminé.
— Et maintenant, Ned Land, ajoutai−je, restons−en là. Plus un mot sur
tout ceci. Le jour où vous serez prêt, vous nous préviendrez et nous vous
suivrons. Je m’en rapporte complètement à vous. »
Cette conversation, qui devait avoir plus tard de si graves conséquences,
se termina ainsi. Je dois dire maintenant que les faits semblèrent confirmer
mes prévisions au grand désespoir du Canadien. Le capitaine Nemo se
défiait−il de nous dans ces mers fréquentées, ou voulait−il seulement se
dérober à la vue des nombreux navires de toutes nations qui sillonnent la
Méditerranée ? Je l’ignore, mais il se maintint le plus souvent entre deux
eaux et au large des côtes. Ou le Nautilus émergeait, ne laissant passer
que la cage du timonier, ou il s’en allait à de grandes profondeurs, car
entre l’archipel grec et l’Asie Mineure nous ne trouvions pas le fond par
deux mille mètres.
Aussi, je n’eus connaissance de l’île de Carpathos, l’une des Sporades,
que par ce vers de Virgile que le capitaine Nemo me cita, en posant son
doigt sur un point du planisphère :
Est in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates
Coeruleus Proteus...
C’était, en effet, l’antique séjour de Protée, le vieux pasteur des troupeaux
de Neptune, maintenant l’île de Scarpanto, située entre Rhodes et la Crète.
Je n’en vis que les soubassements granitiques à travers la vitre du salon.
Le lendemain, 14 février, je résolus d’employer quelques heures à étudier
les poissons de l’Archipel ; mais par un motif quelconque, les panneaux
demeurèrent hermétiquement fermés. En relevant la direction du Nautilus,
je remarquai qu’il marchait vers Candie, l’ancienne île de Crète. Au
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 307
moment où je m’étais embarqué sur I’Abraham−Lincoln, cette île venait
de s’insurger tout entière contre le despotisme turc. Mais ce qu’était
devenue cette insurrection depuis cette époque, je l’ignorais absolument,
et ce n’était pas le capitaine Nemo, privé de toute communication avec la
terre, qui aurait pu me l’apprendre.
Je ne fis donc aucune allusion à cet événement, lorsque, le soir, je me
trouvai seul avec lui dans le salon. D’ailleurs, il me sembla taciturne,
préoccupé. Puis, contrairement à ses habitudes, il ordonna d’ouvrir les
deux panneaux du salon, et, allant de l’un à l’autre, il observa
attentivement la masse des eaux. Dans quel but ? Je ne pouvais le deviner,
et, de mon côté. J’employai mon temps à étudier les poissons qui passaient
devant mes yeux.
Entre autres, je remarquai ces gobies aphyses, citées par Aristote et
vulgairement connues sous le nom de « loches de mer », que l’on
rencontre particulièrement dans les eaux salées avoisinant le delta du Nil.
Près d’elles se déroulaient des pagres à demi phosphorescents, sortes de
spares que les Égyptiens rangeaient parmi les animaux sacrés, et dont
l’arrivée dans les eaux du Reuve, dont elles annonçaient le fécond
débordement, était fêtée par des cérémonies religieuses. Je notai
également des cheilines longues de trois décimètres, poissons osseux à
écailles transparentes, dont la couleur livide est mélangée de taches
rouges ; ce sont de grands mangeurs de végétaux marins, ce qui leur
donne un goût exquis ; aussi ces cheilines étaient−elles très recherchées
des gourmets de l’ancienne Rome, et leurs entrailles, accommodées avec
des laites de murènes, des cervelles de paons et des langues de
phénicoptères, composaient ce plat divin qui ravissait Vitellius.
Un autre habitant de ces mers attira mon attention et ramena dans mon
esprit tous les souvenirs de l’antiquité. Ce fut le rémora qui voyage attaché
au ventre des requins ; au dire des anciens, ce petit poisson, accroché à la
carène d’un navire, pouvait l’arrêter dans sa marche, et l’un d’eux,
retenant le vaisseau d’Antoine pendant la bataille d’Actium, facilita ainsi
la victoire d’Auguste. A quoi tiennent les destinées des nations ! J’observai
également d’admirables anthias qui appartiennent à l’ordre des lutjans,
poissons sacrés pour les Grecs qui leur attribuaient le pouvoir de chasser
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 308
les monstres marins des eaux qu’ils fréquentaient ; leur nom signifie, fleur,
et ils le justifiaient par leurs couleurs chatoyantes, leurs nuances
comprises dans la gamme du rouge depuis la pâleur du rose jusqu’à
l’éclat du rubis, et les fugitifs reflets qui moiraient leur nageoire dorsale.
Mes yeux ne pouvaient se détacher de ces merveilles de la mer, quand ils
furent frappés soudain par une apparition inattendue.
Au milieu des eaux, un homme apparut, un plongeur portant à sa ceinture
une bourse de cuir. Ce n’était pas un corps abandonné aux flots. C’était
un homme vivant qui nageait d’une main vigoureuse, disparaissant parfois
pour aller respirer à la surface et replongeant aussitôt.
Je me retournai vers le capitaine Nemo, et d’une voix émue :
« Un homme ! un naufragé ! m’écriai−je. Il faut le sauver à tout prix ! »
Le capitaine ne me répondit pas et vint s’appuyer à la vitre.
L’homme s’était rapproché, et, la face collée au panneau, il nous
regardait.
A ma profonde stupéfaction, le capitaine Nemo lui fit un signe. Le
plongeur lui répondit de la main, remonta immédiatement vers la surface
de la mer, et ne reparut plus.
« Ne vous inquiétez pas, me dit le capitaine. C’est Nicolas, du cap
Matapan, surnommé le Pesce. Il est bien connu dans toutes les Cyclades.
Un hardi plongeur ! L’eau est son élément, et il y vit plus que sur terre,
allant sans cesse d’une île à l’autre et jusqu’à la Crète.
— Vous le connaissez, capitaine ?
— Pourquoi pas, monsieur Aronnax ? »
Cela dit, le capitaine Nemo se dirigea vers un meuble placé près du
panneau gauche du salon. Près de ce meuble, je vis un coffre cerclé de fer,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 309
dont le couvercle portait sur une plaque de cuivre le chiffre du Nautilus,
avec sa devise Mobilis in mobile.
En ce moment, le capitaine, sans se préoccuper de ma présence, ouvrit le
meuble, sorte de coffre−fort qui renfermait un grand nombre de lingots.
C’étaient des lingots d’or. D’où venait ce précieux métal qui représentait
une somme énorme ? Où le capitaine recueillait−il cet or, et qu’allait−il
faire de celui−ci ?
Je ne prononçai pas un mot. Je regardai. Le capitaine Nemo prit un à un
ces lingots et les rangea méthodiquement dans le coffre qu’il remplit
entièrement. J’estimai qu’il contenait alors plus de mille kilogrammes
d’or, c’est−à−dire près de cinq millions de francs.
Le coffre fut solidement fermé, et le capitaine écrivit sur son couvercle une
adresse en caractères qui devaient appartenir au grec moderne.
Ceci fait, le capitaine Nemo pressa un bouton dont le fil correspondait
avec le poste de l’équipage. Quatre homme parurent, et non sans peine ils
poussèrent le coffre hors du salon. Puis, j’entendis qu’ils le hissaient au
moyen de palans sur l’escalier de fer.
En ce moment, le capitaine Nemo se tourna vers moi :
« Et vous disiez. monsieur le professeur ? me demanda−t−il.
— Je ne disais rien, capitaine.
— Alors, monsieur, vous me permettrez de vous souhaiter le bonsoir. »
Et sur ce, le capitaine Nemo quitta le salon.
Je rentrai dans ma chambre très intrigué, on le conçoit. J’essayai
vainement de dormir. Je cherchais une relation entre l’apparition de ce
plongeur et ce coffre rempli d’or. Bientôt, je sentis à certains mouvements
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 310
de roulis et de tangage, que le Nautilus quittant les couches inférieures
revenait à la surface des eaux.
Puis, j’entendis un bruit de pas sur la plate−forme. Je compris que l’on
détachait le canot, qu’on le lançait à la mer. Il heurta un instant les flancs
du Nautilus, et tout bruit cessa.
Deux heures après, le même bruit, les mêmes allées et venues se
reproduisaient. L’embarcation, hissée à bord, était rajustée dans son
alvéole, et le Nautilus se replongeait sous les flots.
Ainsi donc, ces millions avaient été transportés à leur adresse. Sur quel
point du continent ? Quel était le correspondant du capitaine Nemo ?
Le lendemain, je racontai à Conseil et au Canadien les événements de
cette nuit, qui surexcitaient ma curiosité au plus haut point. Mes
compagnons ne furent pas moins surpris que moi.
« Mais où prend−il ces millions ? » demanda Ned Land.
A cela, pas de réponse possible. Je me rendis au salon après avoir
déjeuné, et je me mis au travail. Jusqu’à cinq heures du soir, je rédigeai
mes notes. En ce moment — devais−je l’attribuer à une disposition
personnelle — je sentis une chaleur extrême, et je dus enlever mon
vêtement de byssus. Effet incompréhensible, car nous n’étions pas sous de
hautes latitudes, et d’ailleurs le Nautilus, immergé, ne devait éprouver
aucune élévation de température. Je regardai le manomètre. Il marquait
une profondeur de soixante pieds, à laquelle la chaleur atmosphérique
n’aurait pu atteindre.
Je continuai mon travail. mais la température s’éleva au point de devenir
intolérable.
« Est−ce que le feu serait à bord ? » me demandai−je.
J’allais quitter le salon, quand le capitaine Nemo entra. Il s’approcha du
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 311
thermomètre, le consulta, et se retournant vers moi :
« Quarante−deux degrés, dit−il.
— Je m’en aperçois, capitaine, répondis−je, et pour peu que cette chaleur
augmente, nous ne pourrons la supporter.
— Oh ! monsieur le professeur, cette chaleur n’augmentera que si nous le
voulons bien.
— Vous pouvez donc la modérer à votre gré ?
— Non, mais je puis m’éloigner du foyer qui la produit.
— Elle est donc extérieure ?
— Sans doute. Nous flottons dans un courant d’eau bouillante.
— Est−il possible ? m’écriai−je.
— Regardez. »
Les panneaux s’ouvrirent, et je vis la mer entièrement blanche autour du
Nautilus. Une fumée de vapeurs sulfureuses se déroulait au milieu des flots
qui bouillonnaient comme l’eau d’une chaudière. J’appuyai ma main sur
une des vitres, mais la chaleur était telle que je dus la retirer.
« Où sommes−nous ? demandai−je.
— Près de l’île Santorin, monsieur le professeur, me répondit le capitaine,
et précisément dans ce canal qui sépare Néa−Kamenni de
Paléa−Kamenni. J’ai voulu vous donner le curieux spectacle d’une
éruption sous−marine.
Je croyais, dis−je, que la formation de ces îles nouvelles était terminée.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 312
— Rien n’est jamais terminé dans les parages volcaniques, répondit le
capitaine Nemo, et le globe y est toujours travaillé par les feux
souterrains. Déjà, en l’an dix−neuf de notre ère, suivant Cassiodore et
Pline, une île nouvelle, Théia la divine, apparut à la place même où se sont
récemment formés ces îlots. Puis, elle s’abîma sous les flots, pour se
remontrer en l’an soixante−neuf et s’abîmer encore une fois. Depuis cette
époque jusqu’à nos jours, le travail plutonien fut suspendu. Mais, le 3
février 1866, un nouvel îlot, qu’on nomma l’îlot de George, émergea au
milieu des vapeurs sulfureuses, près de Néa−Kamenni, et s’y souda, le 6
du même mois. Sept jours après, le 13 février, l’îlot Aphroessa parut,
laissant entre Néa−Kamenni et lui un canal de dix mètres. J’étais dans ces
mers quand le phénomène se produisit, et j’ai pu en observer toutes les
phases. L’îlot Aphroessa, de forme arrondie, mesurait trois cents pieds de
diamètre sur trente pieds de hauteur. Il se composait de laves noires et
vitreuses, mêlées de fragments feldspathiques. Enfin, le 10 mars, un îlot
plus petit, appelé Réka, se montra près de Néa−Kamenni, et depuis lors,
ces trois îlots, soudés ensemble, ne forment plus qu’une seule et même île.
— Et le canal où nous sommes en ce moment ? demandai−je.
— Le voici, répondit le capitaine Nemo, en me montrant une carte de
l’Archipel. Vous voyez que j’y ai porté les nouveaux îlots.
— Mais ce canal se comblera un jour ?
— C’est probable, monsieur Aronnax, car, depuis 1866, huit petits îlots de
lave ont surgi en face du port Saint−Nicolas de Paléa−Kamenni. Il est
donc évident que Néa et Paléa se réuniront dans un temps rapproché. Si,
au milieu du Pacifique, ce sont les infusoires qui forment les continents,
ici, ce sont les phénomènes éruptifs. Voyez, monsieur, voyez le travail qui
s’accomplit sous ces flots. »
Je revins vers la vitre. Le Nautilus ne marchait plus. La chaleur devenait
intolérable. De blanche qu’elle était. la mer se faisait rouge, coloration
due à la présence d’un sel de fer. Malgré l’hermétique fermeture du salon,
une odeur sulfureuse insupportable se dégageait, et j’apercevais des
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 313
flammes écarlates dont la vivacité tuait l’éclat de l’électricité.
J’étais en nage, j’étouffais, j’allais cuire. Oui, en vérité, je me
sentais cuire !
« On ne peut rester plus longtemps dans cette eau
bouillante, dis−je au capitaine.
— Non, ce ne serait pas prudent », répondit l’impassible
Nemo.
Un ordre fut donné. Le Nautilus vira de bord et s’éloigna de
cette fournaise qu’il ne pouvait impunément braver. Un quart
d’heure plus tard, nous respirions à la surface des flots.
La pensée me vint alors que si Ned Land avait choisi ces parages pour
effectuer notre fuite, nous ne serions pas sortis vivants de cette mer de feu.
Le lendemain, 16 février, nous quittions ce bassin qui entre Rhodes et
Alexandrie, compte des profondeurs de trois mille mètres, et le Nautilus
passant au large de Cerigo, abandonnait l’archipel grec, après avoir
doublé le cap Matapan.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
L'archipel grec 314
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures
La Méditerranée, la mer bleue par excellence, la « grande mer » des
Hébreux, la « mer » des Grecs, le « mare nostrum » des Romains, bordée
d’orangers, d’aloès, de cactus, de pins maritimes, embaumée du parfum
des myrtes, encadrée de rudes montagnes, saturée d’un air pur et
transparent, mais incessamment travaillée par les feux de la terre, est un
véritable monde. C’est là, sur ses rivages et sur ses eaux, dit Michelet, que
l’homme se retrempe dans l’un des plus puissants climats du globe.
Mais si beau qu’il soit, je n’ai pu prendre qu’un aperçu rapide de ce
bassin, dont la superficie couvre deux millions de kilomètres carrés. Les
connaissances personnelles du capitaine Nemo me firent même défaut, car
l’énigmatique personnage ne parut pas une seule fois pendant cette
traversée à grande vitesse. J’estime à six cents lieues environ le chemin
que le Nautilus parcourut sous les flots de cette mer, et ce voyage, il
l’accomplit en deux fois vingt−quatre heures. Partis le matin du 16 février
des parages de la Grèce, le 18, au soleil levant, nous avions franchi le
détroit de Gibraltar.
— Il fut évident pour moi que cette Méditerranée, resserrée au milieu de
ces terres qu’il voulait fuir, déplaisait au capitaine Nemo. Ses flots et ses
brises lui rapportaient trop de souvenirs, sinon trop de regrets. Il n’avait
plus ici cette liberté d’allures, cette indépendance de manoeuvres que lui
laissaient les océans, et son Nautilus se sentait à l’étroit entre ces rivages
rapprochés de l’Afrique et de l’Europe.
Aussi, notre vitesse fut−elle de vingt−cinq milles à l’heure, soit douze
lieues de quatre kilomètres. Il va sans dire que Ned Land, à son grand
ennui, dut renoncer à ses projets de fuite. Il ne pouvait se servir du canot
entraîné à raison de douze à treize mètres par seconde. Quitter le Nautilus
dans ces conditions, c’eût été sauter d’un train marchant avec cette
rapidité, manoeuvre imprudente s’il en fut. D’ailleurs, notre appareil ne
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 315
remontait que la nuit à la surface des flots, afin de renouveler sa provision
d’air, et il se dirigeait seulement suivant les indications de la boussole et
les relèvements du loch.
Je ne vis donc de l’intérieur de cette Méditerranée que ce que le voyageur
d’un express aperçoit du paysage qui fuit devant ses yeux, c’est−à−dire
les horizons lointains, et non les premiers plans qui passent comme un
éclair. Cependant, Conseil et moi, nous pûmes observer quelques−uns de
ces poissons méditerranéens, que la puissance de leurs nageoires
maintenait quelques instants dans les eaux du Nautilus. Nous restions à
l’affût devant les vitres du salon, et nos notes me permettent de refaire en
quelques mots l’ichtyologie de cette mer.
Des divers poissons qui l’habitent, j’ai vu les uns, entrevu les autres, sans
parler de ceux que la vitesse du Nautilus déroba à mes yeux. Qu’il me soit
donc permis de les classer d’après cette classification fantaisiste. Elle
rendra mieux mes rapides observations.
Au milieu de la masse des eaux vivement éclairées par les nappes
électriques, serpentaient quelques−unes de ces lamproies longues d’un
mètre, qui sont communes à presque tous les climats. Des oxyrhinques,
sortes de raies, larges de cinqbpieds, au ventre blanc, au dos gris cendré
et tacheté, se développaient comme de vastes châles emportés par les
courants. D’autres raies passaient si vite que je ne pouvais reconnaître si
elles méritaient ce nom d’aigles qui leur fut donné par les Grecs, ou ces
qualifications de rat, de crapaud et de chauve−souris, dont les pêcheurs
modernes les ont affublées. Des squales−milandres, longs de douze pieds
et particulièrement redoutés des plongeurs, luttaient de rapidité entre eux.
Des renards marins, longs de huit pieds et doués d’une extrême finesse
d’odorat, apparaissaient comme de grandes ombres bleuâtres. Des
dorades, du genre spare, dont quelques−unes mesuraient jusqu’à treize
décimètres. se montraient dans leur vêtement d’argent et d’azur entouré de
bandelettes, qui tranchait sur le ton sombre de leurs nageoires, poissons
consacrés à Vénus, et dont l’oeil est enchâssé dans un sourcil d’or ; espèce
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 316
précieuse, amie de toutes les eaux, douces ou salées, habitant les fleuves,
les lacs et les océans, vivant sous tous les climats, supportant toutes les
températures, et dont la race, qui remonte aux époques géologiques de la
terre, a conserve toute sa beauté des premiers jours. Des esturgeons
magnifiques, longs de neuf à dix mètres, animaux de grande marche,
heurtaient d’une queue puissante la vitre des panneaux. montrant leur dos
bleuâtre à petites taches brunes : ils ressemblent aux squales dont ils
n’égalent pas la force, et se rencontrent dans toutes les mers ; au
printemps, ils aiment à remonter les grands fleuves, à lutter contre les
courants du Volga, du Danube, du Pô, du Rhin, de la Loire, de l’Oder, et
se nourrissent de harengs, de maquereaux, de saumons et de gades ; bien
qu’ils appartiennent à la classe des cartilagineux, ils sont délicats ; on les
mange frais, séchés, marinés ou salés, et, autrefois, on les portait
triomphalement sur la table des Lucullus. Mais de ces divers habitants de
la Méditerranée, ceux que je pus observer le plus utilement, lorsque le
Nautilus se rapprochait de la surface, appartenaient au
soixante−troisième genre des poissons osseux. C’étaient des
scombres−thons, au dos bleu−noir, au ventre cuiras d’argent, et dont les
rayons dorsaux jettent des lueurs d’or. Ils ont la réputation de suivre la
marche des navires dont ils recherchent l’ombre fraîche sous les feux du
ciel tropical, et ils ne la démentirent pas en accompagnant le Nautilus
comme ils accompagnèrent autrefois les vaisseaux de Lapérouse. Pendant
de longues heures, ils luttèrent de vitesse avec notre appareil. Je ne
pouvais me lasser d’admirer ces animaux véritablement taillés pour la
course, leur tête petite, leur corps lisse et fusiforme qui chez quelques−uns
dépassait trois mètres, leurs pectorales douées d’une remarquable vigueur
et leurs caudales fourchues. Ils nageaient en triangle, comme certaines
troupes d’oiseaux dont ils égalaient la rapidité, ce qui faisait dire aux
anciens que la géométrie et la stratégie leur étaient familières. Et
cependant ils n’échappent point aux poursuites des Provençaux, qui les
estiment comme les estimaient les habitants de la Propontide et de l’Italie,
et c’est en aveugles, en étourdis, que ces pré marseillaises.
Je citerai, pour mémoire seulement, ceux des poissons méditerranéens que
Conseil ou moi nous ne fîmes qu’entrevoir. C’étaient des
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 317
gymontes−fierasfers blanchâtres qui passaient comme d’insaisissables
vapeurs, des murènes−congres, serpents de trois à quatre mètres enjolivés
de vert, de bleu et de jaune, des gades−merlus, longs de trois pieds, dont le
foie formait un morceau délicat, des coepoles−ténias qui flottaient comme
de fines algues, des trygles que les poètes appellent poissons−lyres et les
marins poissons−siffleurs, et dont le museau est orné de deux lames
triangulaires et dentelées qui figurent l’instrument du vieil Homère, des
trygles−hirondelles, nageant avec la rapidité de l’oiseau dont ils ont pris
le nom, des holocentres−mérons, à tête rouge, dont la nageoire dorsale est
garnie de filaments, des aloses agrémentées de taches noires, grises,
brunes, bleues, jaunes, vertes, qui sont sensibles à la voix argentine des
clochettes, et de splendides turbots, ces faisans de la mer, sortes de
losanges à nageoires jaunâtres, pointillés de brun, et dont le coté
supérieur, le côté gauche, est généralement marbré de brun et de jaune,
enfin des troupes d’admirables mulles rougets, véritables paradisiers de
l’Océan, que les Romains payaient jusqu’à dix mille sesterces la pièce, et
qu’ils faisaient mourir sur leur table, pour suivre d’un oeil cruel leurs
changements de couleurs depuis le rouge cinabre de la vie jusqu’au blanc
pâle de la mort.
Et si je ne pus observer ni miralets, ni balistes, ni tétrodons, ni
hippocampes, ni jouans, ni centrisques, ni blennies, ni surmulets, ni labres,
ni éperlans, ni exocets, ni anchois, ni pagels, ni bogues, ni orphes, ni tous
ces principaux représentants de l’ordre des pleuronectes, les limandes, les
flez, les plies, les soles, les carrelets, communs à l’Atlantique et à la
Méditerranée, il faut en accuser la vertigineuse vitesse qui emportait le
Nautilus à travers ces eaux opulentes.
Quant aux mammifères marins, je crois avoir reconnu en passant à
l’ouvert de l’Adriatique, deux ou trois cachalots, munis d’une nageoire
dorsale du genre des physétères, quelques dauphins du genre des
globicéphales, spéciaux à la Méditerranée et dont la partie antérieure de
la tête est zébrée de petites lignes claires, et aussi une douzaine de
phoques au ventre blanc, au pelage noir, connus sous le nom de moines et
qui ont absolument l’air de Dominicains longs de trois mètres.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 318
Pour sa part, Conseil croit avoir aperçu une tortue large de six pieds,
ornée de trois arêtes saillantes dirigées longitudinalement. Je regrettai de
ne pas avoir vu ce reptile, car, à la description que m’en fit Conseil, je
crus reconnaître le luth qui forme une espèce assez rare. Je ne remarquai,
pour mon compte, que quelques cacouannes a carapace allongée.
Quant aux zoophytes. je pus admirer. pendant quelques instants. une
admirable galéolaire orangée qui s’accrocha à la vitre du panneau de
bâbord ; c’était un long filament ténu, s'arborisant en branches infinies et
terminées par la plus fine dentelle qu’eussent jamais filée les rivales
d’Arachné. Je ne pus, malheureusement, pêcher cet admirable échantillon,
et aucun autre zoophyte méditerranéen ne se fût sans doute offert à mes
regards, si le Nautilus, dans la soirée du 16, n’eût singulièrement ralenti
sa vitesse. Voici dans quelles circonstances.
Nous passions alors entre la Sicile et la côte de Tunis. Dans cet espace
resserré entre le cap Bon et le détroit de Messine, le fond de la mer
remonte presque subitement. Là s’est formée une véritable crête sur
laquelle il ne reste que dix−sept mètres d’eau, tandis que de chaque côté
la profondeur est de cent soixante−dix mètres. Le Nautilus dut donc
manoeuvrer prudemment afin de ne pas se heurter contre cette barrière
sous−marine.
Je montrai à Conseil, sur la carte de la Méditerranée, l’emplacement
qu’occupait ce long récif.
« Mais, n’en déplaise à monsieur, fit observer Conseil, c’est comme un
isthme véritable qui réunit l’Europe à l’Afrique.
— Oui, mon garçon, répondis−je, il barre en entier le détroit de Libye, et
les sondages de Smith ont prouvé que les continents étaient autrefois
réunis entre le cap Boco et le cap Furina.
— Je le crois volontiers, dit Conseil.
— J’ajouterai, repris−je, qu’une barrière semblable existe entre Gibraltar
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 319
et Ceuta, qui, aux temps géologiques, fermait complètement la
Méditerranée.
— Eh ! fit Conseil, si quelque poussée volcanique relevait un jour ces deux
barrières au−dessus des flots !
— Ce n’est guère probable, Conseil.
— Enfin, que monsieur me permette d’achever, si ce phénomène se
produisait, ce serait fâcheux pour monsieur de Lesseps, qui se donne tant
de mal pour percer son isthme !
— J’en conviens, mais, je te le répète, Conseil, ce phénomène ne se
produira pas. La violence des forces souterraines va toujours diminuant.
Les volcans, si nombreux aux premiers jours du monde, s’éteignent peu à
peu, la chaleur interne s’affaiblit, la température des couches inférieures
du globe baisse d’une quantité appréciable par siècle, et au détriment de
notre globe, car cette chaleur, c’est sa vie.
— Cependant, le soleil...
— Le soleil est insuffisant, Conseil. Peut−il rendre la chaleur à un
cadavre ?
— Non, que je sache.
— Eh bien, mon ami, la terre sera un jour ce cadavre refroidi. Elle
deviendra inhabitable et sera inhabitée comme la lune, qui depuis
longtemps a perdu sa chaleur vitale.
— Dans combien de siècles ? demanda Conseil.
— Dans quelques centaines de mille ans, mon garçon.
— Alors, répondit Conseil, nous avons le temps d’achever notre voyage, si
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 320
toutefois Ned Land ne s’en mêle pas ! »
Et Conseil, rassuré, se remit à étudier le haut−fond que le
Nautilus rasait de près avec une vitesse modérée.
Là, sous un sol rocheux et volcanique, s’épanouissait toute une flore
vivante, des éponges, des holoturies, des cydippes hyalines ornées de
cyrrhes rougeâtres et qui émettaient une légère phosphorescence, des
beroës, vulgairement connus sous le nom de concombres de mer et baignés
dans les miroitements d’un spectre solaire, des comatules ambulantes,
larges d’un mètre, et dont la pourpre rougissait les eaux, des euryales
arborescentes de la plus grande beauté, des pavonacées à longues tiges,
un grand nombre d’oursins comestibles d’espèces variées, et des actinies
vertes au tronc grisâtre, au disque brun, qui se perdaient dans leur
chevelure olivâtre de tentacules.
Conseil s’était occupé plus particulièrement d’observer les mollusques et
les articulés, et bien que la nomenclature en soit un peu aride, je ne veux
pas faire tort à ce brave garçon en omettant ses observations personnelles.
Dans l’embranchement des mollusques, il cite de nombreux pétoncles
pectiniformes, des spondyles pieds−d’âne qui s’entassaient les uns sur les
autres, des donaces triangulaires, des hyalles tridentées, à nageoires
jaunes et à coquilles transparentes, des pleurobranches orangés, des oeufs
pointillés ou semés de points verdâtres, des aplysies connues aussi sous le
nom de lièvres de mer, des dolabelles, des acères charnus, des ombrelles
spéciales à la Méditerranée, des oreilles de mer dont la coquille produit
une nacre très recherchée, des pétoncles flammulés, des anomies que les
Languedociens, dit−on, préfèrent aux huîtres, des clovis si chers aux
Marseillais, des praires doubles, blanches et grasses, quelques−uns de ces
clams qui abondent sur les côtes de l’Amérique du Nord et dont il se fait
un débit si considérable à New York, des peignes operculaires de couleurs
variées, des lithodonces enfoncées dans leurs trous et dont je goûtais fort
le goût poivré, des vénéricardes sillonnées dont la coquille à sommet
bombé présentait des côtes saillantes, des cynthies hérissées de tubercules
écarlates, des carniaires à pointe recourbées et semblables à de légères
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 321
gondoles, des féroles couronnées, des atlantes à coquilles spiraliformes,
des thétys grises, tachetées de blanc et recouvertes de leur mantille
frangée, des éolides semblables à de petites limaces, des cavolines
rampant sur le dos, des auricules et entre autres l’auricule myosotis, à
coquille ovale, des scalaires fauves, des littorines, des janthures, des
cinéraires, des pétricoles, des lamellaires, des cabochons, des pandores,
etc.
Quant aux articulés, Conseil les a, sur ses notes, très justement divisés en
six classes, dont trois appartiennent au monde marin. Ce sont les classes
des crustacés, des cirrhopodes et des annélides.
Les crustacés se subdivisent en neuf ordres, et le premier de ces ordres
comprend les décapodes, c’est−à−dire les animaux dont la tête et le
thorax sont le plus généralement soudés entre eux, dont l’appareil buccal
est composé de plusieurs paires de membres, et qui possèdent quatre, cinq
ou six paires de pattes thoraciques ou ambulatoires. Conseil avait suivi la
méthode de notre maître Milne Edwards, qui fait trois sections des
décapodes : les brachyoures, les macroures et les anomoures. Ces noms
sont légèrement barbares, mais ils sont justes et précis. Parmi les
macroures, Conseil cite des amathies dont le front est armé de deux
grandes pointes divergentes, l’inachus scorpion, qui — je ne sais pourquoi
— symbolisait la sagesse chez les Grecs, des lambres−masséna, des
lambres−spinimanes, probablement égarés sur ce haut−fond, car
d’ordinaire ils vivent à de grandes profondeurs, des xhantes, des pilumnes,
des rhomboldes, des calappiens granuleux — très faciles à digérer, fait
observer Conseil — des corystes édentés, des ébalies, des cymopolies, des
dorripes laineuses, etc. Parmi les macroures, subdivisés en cinq familles,
les cuirassés, les fouisseurs, les astaciens, les salicoques et les
ochyzopodes, il cite des langoustes communes, dont la chair est si estimée
chez les femelles, des scyllares−ours ou cigales de mer, des gébies
riveraines, et toutes sortes d’espèces comestibles, mais il ne dit rien de la
subdivision des astaciens qui comprend les homards, car les langoustes
sont les seuls homards de la Méditerranée. Enfin, parmi les anomoures, il
vit des drocines communes, abritées derrière cette coquille abandonnée
dont elles s’emparent, des homoles à front épineux, des bernard−l’ermite,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 322
des porcellanes, etc.
Là s’arrêtait le travail de Conseil. Le temps lui avait manqué pour
compléter la classe des crustacés par l’examen des stomapodes, des
amphipodes, des homopodes, des isopodes, des trilobites, des
branchiapodes, des ostracodes et des entomostracées. Et pour terminer
l’étude des articulés marins, il aurait dû citer la classe des cyrrhopodes
qui renferme les cyclopes, les argules, et la classe des annélides qu’il n’eût
pas manqué de diviser en tubicoles et en dorsibranches. Mais le Nautilus,
ayant dépassé le haut−fond du détroit de Libye, reprit dans les eaux plus
profondes sa vitesse accoutumée. Dès lors plus de mollusques, plus
d’articulés, plus de zoophytes. A peine quelques gros poissons qui
passaient comme des ombres.
Pendant la nuit du 16 au 17 février, nous étions entrés dans ce second
bassin méditerranéen, dont les plus grandes profondeurs se trouvent par
trois mille mètres. Le Nautilus, sous l’impulsion de son hélice, glissant sur
ses plans inclinés, s’enfonça jusqu’aux dernières couches de la mer.
Là, à défaut des merveilles naturelles, la masse des eaux offrit à mes
regards bien des scènes émouvantes et terribles. En effet, nous traversions
alors toute cette partie de la Méditerranée si féconde en sinistres. De la
côte algérienne aux rivages de la Provence, que de navires ont fait
naufrage, que de bâtiments ont disparu ! La Méditerranée n’est qu’un lac,
comparée aux vastes plaines liquides du Pacifique, mais c’est un lac
capricieux, aux flots changeants, aujourd’hui propice et caressant pour la
frêle tartane qui semble flotter entre le double outre−mer des eaux et du
ciel, demain, rageur tourmenté, démonté par les vents, brisant les plus
forts navires de ses lames courtes qui les frappent à coups précipités.
Ainsi, dans cette promenade rapide à travers les couches profondes, que
d’épaves j’aperçus gisant sur le sol, les unes déjà empâtées par les coraux,
les autres revêtues seulement d’une couche de rouille, des ancres, des
canons, des boulets, des garnitures de fer, des branches d’hélice, des
morceaux de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 323
machines, des cylindres brisés, des chaudières défoncées, puis des coques
flottant entre deux eaux, celles−ci droites, celles−là renversées.
De ces navires naufragés, les uns avaient péri par collision, les autres
pour avoir heurté quelque écueil de granit. J’en vis qui avaient coulé à
pic, la mâture droite, le gréement raidi par l’eau. Ils avaient l’air d’être à
l’ancre dans une immense rade foraine et d’attendre le moment du départ.
Lorsque le Nautilus passait entre eux et les enveloppait de ses nappes
électriques, il semblait que ces navires allaient le saluer de leur pavillon et
lui envoyer leur numéro d’ordre ! Mais non, rien que le silence et la mort
sur ce champ des catastrophes !
J’observai que les fonds méditerranéens étaient plus encombrés de ces
sinistres épaves à mesure que le Nautilus se rapprochait du détroit de
Gibraltar. Les côtes d’Afrique et d’Europe se resserrent alors, et dans cet
étroit espace, les rencontres sont fréquentes. Je vis là de nombreuses
carènes de fer, des ruines fantastiques de steamers, les uns couchés, les
autres debout, semblables à des animaux formidables. Un de ces bateaux
aux flancs ouverts, sa cheminée courbée, ses roues dont il ne restait plus
que la monture, son gouvernail séparé de l’étambot et retenu encore par
une chaîne de fer, son tableau d’arrière rongé par les sels marins, se
présentait sous un aspect
terrible ! Combien d’existences brisées dans son naufrage ! Combien de
victimes entraînées sous les flots ! Quelque matelot du bord avait−il
survécu pour raconter ce terrible désastre, ou les flots gardaient−ils
encore le secret de ce sinistre ? Je ne sais pourquoi, il me vint à la pensée
que ce bateau enfoui sous la mer pouvait être l’Atlas, disparu corps et
biens depuis une vingtaine d’années, et dont on n’a jamais entendu
parler ! Ah ! quelle sinistre histoire serait à faire que celle de ces fonds
méditerranéens, de ce vaste ossuaire, où tant de richesses se sont perdues,
où tant de victimes ont trouvé la mort !
Cependant, le Nautilus, indifférent et rapide, courait à toute hélice au
milieu de ces ruines. Le 18 février, vers trois heures du matin, il se
présentait à l’entrée du détroit de Gibraltar.
Là existent deux courants : un courant supérieur, depuis longtemps
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 324
reconnu, qui amène les eaux de l’Océan dans le bassin de la
Méditerranée ; puis un contre−courant inférieur, dont le raisonnement a
démontré aujourd’hui l’existence. En effet, la somme des eaux de la
Méditerranée, incessamment accrue par les flots de l’Atlantique et par les
fleuves qui s’y jettent, devrait élever chaque année le niveau de cette mer,
car son évaporation est insuffisante pour rétablir l’équilibre. Or, il n’en
est pas ainsi, et on a dû naturellement admettre l’existence d’un courant
inférieur qui par le détroit de Gibraltar verse dans le bassin de
l’Atlantique le trop−plein de la Méditerranée.
Fait exact, en effet. C’est de ce contre−courant que profita le Nautilus. Il
s’avança rapidement par l’étroite passe. Un instant je pus entrevoir les
admirables ruines du temple d’Hercule enfoui, au dire de Pline et
d’Avienus, avec l’île basse qui le supportait, et quelques minutes plus tard
nous flottions sur les flots de l’Atlantique.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La Méditerranée en quarante−huit heures 325
La baie de Vigo
L’Atlantique ! Vaste étendue d’eau dont la superficie couvre vingt−cinq
millions de milles carrés, longue de neuf mille milles sur une largeur
moyenne de deux mille sept cents. Importante mer presque ignorée des
anciens, sauf peut−être des Carthaginois, ces Hollandais de l’antiquité,
qui dans leurs pérégrinations commerciales suivaient les côtes ouest de
l’Europe et de l’Afrique ! Océan dont les rivages aux sinuosités parallèles
embrassent un périmètre immense, arrosé par les plus grands fleuves du
monde, le Saint−Laurent, le Mississipi, l’Amazone, la Plata, l’Orénoque,
le Niger, le Sénégal, l’Elbe, la Loire, le Rhin, qui lui apportent les eaux
des pays les plus civilisés et des contrées les plus sauvages ! Magnifique
plaine, incessamment sillonnée par les navires de toutes les nations,
abritée sous tous les pavillons du monde, et que terminent ces deux pointes
terribles, redoutées des navigateurs, le cap Horn et le cap des Tempêtes !
Le Nautilus en brisait les eaux sous le tranchant de son éperon, après
avoir accompli près de dix mille lieues en trois mois et demi, parcours
supérieur à l’un des grands cercles de la terre. Où allions−nous
maintenant, et que nous réservait l’avenir ?
Le Nautilus, sorti du détroit de Gibraltar, avait pris le large. Il revint à la
surface des flots, et nos promenades quotidiennes sur la plate−forme nous
furent ainsi rendues.
J’y montai aussitôt accompagné de Ned Land et de Conseil. A une distance
de douze milles apparaissait vaguement le cap Saint−Vincent qui forme la
pointe sud−ouest de la péninsule hispanique. Il ventait un assez fort coup
de vent du sud. La mer était grosse, houleuse. Elle imprimait de violentes
secousses de roulis au Nautilus. Il était presque impossible de se maintenir
sur la plate−forme que d’énormes paquets de mer battaient à chaque
instant. Nous redescendîmes donc après avoir humé quelques bouffées
d’air.
La baie de Vigo 326
Je regagnai ma chambre. Conseil revint à sa cabine mais le Canadien,
l’air assez préoccupé, me suivit. Notre rapide passage à travers la
Méditerranée ne lui avait pas permis de mettre ses projets à exécution, et il
dissimulait peu son désappointement.
Lorsque la porte de ma chambre fut fermée, il s’assit et me regarda
silencieusement.
« Ami Ned, lui dis−je, je vous comprends, mais vous n’avez rien à vous
reprocher. Dans les conditions ou naviguait le Nautilus, songer à le quitter
eût été de la folie ! »
Ned Land ne répondit rien. Ses lèvres serrées, ses sourcils froncés,
indiquaient chez lui la violente obsession d’une idée fixe.
« Voyons, repris−je, rien n’est désespéré encore. Nous remontons la côte
du Portugal. Non loin sont la France, l’Angleterre, où nous trouverions
facilement un refuge. Ah ! si le Nautilus, sorti du détroit de Gibraltar,
avait mis le cap au sud, s’il nous eût entraînés vers ces régions à les
continents manquent, je partagerais vos inquiétudes. Mais, nous le savons
maintenant, le capitaine Nemo ne fuit pas les mers civilisées, et dans
quelques jours, je crois que vous pourrez agir avec quelque sécurité. »
Ned Land me regarda plus fixement encore, et desserrant enfin les lèvres :
« C’est pour ce soir », dit−il.
Je me redressai subitement. J’étais, je l’avoue, peu préparé à cette
communication. J’aurais voulu répondre au Canadien, mais les mots ne
me vinrent pas.
« Nous étions convenus d’attendre une circonstance reprit Ned Land. La
circonstance, je la tiens. Ce soir, nous ne serons qu’à quelques milles de la
côte espagnole. La nuit est sombre. Le vent souffle du large. J’ai votre
parole, monsieur Aronnax, et je compte sur vous. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 327
Comme je me taisais toujours, le Canadien se leva, et se rapprochant de
moi :
« Ce soir, à neuf heures, dit−il. J’ai prévenu Conseil. A ce moment−là, le
capitaine Nemo sera enfermé dans sa chambre et probablement couché. Ni
les mécaniciens, ni les hommes de l’équipage ne peuvent nous voir.
Conseil et moi, nous gagnerons l’escalier central. Vous, monsieur
Aronnax, vous resterez dans la bibliothèque à deux pas de nous, attendant
mon signal. Les avirons, le mât et la voile sont dans le canot. Je suis même
parvenu à y porter quelques provisions. Je me suis procuré une clef
anglaise pour dévisser les écrous qui attachent le canot à la coque du
Nautilus. Ainsi tout est prêt. A ce soir.
— La mer est mauvaise, dis−je.
— J’en conviens, répond le Canadien, mais il faut risquer cela. La liberté
vaut qu’on la paye. D’ailleurs, l’embarcation est solide, et quelques milles
avec un vent qui porte ne sont pas une affaire. Qui sait si demain nous ne
serons pas à cent lieues au large ? Que les circonstances nous favorisent,
et entre dix et onze heures, nous serons débarqués sur quelque point de la
terre ferme ou morts. Donc, à la grâce de Dieu et à ce soir ! »
Sur ce mot, le Canadien se retira, me laissant presque abasourdi. J’avais
imaginé que, le cas échéant, j’aurais eu le temps de réfléchir, de discuter.
Mon opiniâtre compagnon ne
me le permettait pas. Que lui aurais−je dit, après tout ? Ned Land avait
cent fois raison. C’était presque une circonstance, il en profitait.
Pouvais−je revenir sur ma parole et assumer cette responsabilité de
compromettre dans un intérêt tout personnel l’avenir de mes
compagnons ? Demain, le capitaine Nemo ne pouvait−il pas nous
entraîner au large de toutes terres ?
En ce moment, un sifflement assez fort m’apprit que les réservoirs se
remplissaient, et le Nautilus s’enfonça sous les flots de l’Atlantique.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 328
Je demeurai dans ma chambre. Je voulais éviter le capitaine pour cacher à
ses yeux l’émotion qui me dominait. Triste Journée que je passai ainsi,
entre le désir de rentrer en possession de mon libre arbitre et le regret
d’abandonner ce merveilleux Nautilus, laissant inachevées mes études
sous−marines ! Quitter ainsi cet océan, « mon Atlantique », comme je me
plaisais à le nommer, sans en avoir observé les dernières couches, sans lui
avoir dérobé ces secrets que m’avaient révélés les mers des Indes et du
Pacifique ! Mon roman me tombait des mains dès le premier volume, mon
rêve s’interrompait au plus beau moment ! Quelles heures mauvaises
s’écoulèrent ainsi, tantôt me voyant en sûreté, à terre, avec mes
compagnons, tantôt souhaitant, en dépit de ma raison, que quelque
circonstance imprévue empêchât la réalisation des projets de Ned Land.
Deux fois je vins au salon. Je voulais consulter le compas. Je voulais voir
si la direction du Nautilus nous rapprochait, en effet, ou nous éloignait de
la côte. Mais non. Le Nautilus se tenait toujours dans les eaux portugaises.
Il pointait au nord en prolongeant les rivages de l’Océan.
Il fallait donc en prendre son parti et se préparer à fuir. Mon bagage
n’était pas lourd. Mes notes, rien de plus.
Quant au capitaine Nemo, je me demandai ce qu’il penserait de notre
évasion, quelles inquiétudes, quels torts peut−être elle lui causerait, et ce
qu’il ferait dans le double cas où elle serait ou révélée ou manquée ! Sans
doute je n’avais pas à me plaindre de lui, au contraire. Jamais hospitalité
ne fut plus franche que la sienne. En le quittant, je ne pouvais être taxé
d’ingratitude. Aucun serment ne nous liait à lui. C’était sur la force des
choses seule qu’il comptait et non sur notre parole pour nous fixer à
jamais auprès de lui. Mais cette prétention hautement avouée de nous
retenir éternellement prisonniers à son bord justifiait toutes nos tentatives.
Je n’avais pas revu le capitaine depuis notre visite à l’île de Santorin. Le
hasard devait−il me mettre en sa présence avant notre départ ? Je le
désirais et je le craignais tout à la fois. J’écoutai si je ne l’entendrais pas
marcher dans sa chambre contiguë à la mienne. Aucun bruit ne parvint à
mon oreille. Cette chambre devait être déserte.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 329
Alors j’en vins à me demander si cet étrange personnage était à bord.
Depuis cette nuit pendant laquelle le canot avait quitté le Nautilus pour un
service mystérieux, mes idées s’étaient, en ce qui le concerne, légèrement
modifiées. Je pensais, bien qu’il eût pu dire, que le capitaine Nemo devait
avoir conservé avec la terre quelques relations d’une certaine espèce. Ne
quittait−il jamais le Nautilus ? Des semaines entières s’étaient souvent
écoulées sans que je l’eusse rencontré. Que faisait−il pendant ce temps, et
alors que je le croyais en proie à des accès de misanthropie,
n’accomplissait−il pas au loin quelque acte secret dont la nature
m’échappait jusqu’ici ?
Toutes ces idées et mille autres m’assaillirent à la fois. Le champ des
conjectures ne peut être qu’infini dans l’étrange situation où nous sommes.
J’éprouvais un malaise insupportable. Cette journée d’attente me semblait
éternelle. Les heures sonnaient trop lentement au gré de mon impatience.
Mon dîner me fut comme toujours servi dans ma chambre. Je mangeai
mal, étant trop préoccupé. Je quittai la table à sept heures. Cent vingt
minutes — je les comptais — me séparaient encore du moment où je devais
rejoindre Ned Land. Mon agitation redoublait. Mon pouls battait avec
violence. Je ne pouvais rester immobile. J’allais et venais, espérant calmer
par le mouvement le trouble de mon esprit. L’idée de succomber dans
notre téméraire entreprise était le moins pénible de mes soucis ; mais à la
pensée de voir notre projet découvert avant d’avoir quitté le Nautilus, à la
pensée d’être ramené devant le capitaine Nemo irrité, ou, ce qui eût été
pis, contristé de mon abandon, mon coeur palpitait.
Je voulus revoir le salon une dernière fois. Je pris par les coursives, et
j’arrivai dans ce musée où j’avais passé tant d’heures agréables et utiles.
Je regardai toutes ces richesses, tous ces trésors, comme un homme à la
veille d’un éternel exil et qui part pour ne plus revenir. Ces merveilles de
la nature, ces chefs−d’oeuvre de l’art, entre lesquels depuis tant de jours
se concentrait ma vie, j’allais les abandonner pour jamais. J’aurais voulu
plonger mes regards par la vitre du salon à travers les eaux de
l’Atlantique ; mais les panneaux étaient hermétiquement fermés et un
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 330
manteau de tôle me séparait de cet Océan que je ne connaissais pas
encore.
En parcourant ainsi le salon, j’arrivai près de la porte, ménagée dans le
pan coupé, qui s’ouvrait sur la chambre du capitaine. A mon grand
étonnement, cette porte était entrebâillée. Je reculai involontairement. Si
le capitaine Nemo était dans sa chambre, il pouvait me voir. Cependant,
n’entendant aucun bruit, je m’approchai. La chambre était déserte. Je
poussai la porte. Je fis quelques pas à l’intérieur. Toujours le même aspect
sévère, cénobitique.
En cet instant, quelques eaux−fortes suspendues à la paroi et que je
n’avais pas remarquées pendant ma première visite, frappèrent mes
regards. C’étaient des portraits, des portraits de ces grands hommes
historiques dont l’existence n’a été qu’un perpétuel dévouement à une
grande idée humaine, Kosciusko, le héros tombé au cri de Finis Polonioe,
Botzaris, le Léonidas de la Grèce moderne, O’Connell, le défenseur de
l’Irlande, Washington, le fondateur de l’Union américaine, Manin, le
patriote italien, Lincoln, tombé sous la balle d’un esclavagiste, et enfin, ce
martyr de l’affranchissement de la race noire, John Brown, suspendu à
son gibet, tel que l’a si terriblement dessiné le crayon de Victor Hugo.
Quel lien existait−il entre ces âmes héroïques et l’âme du capitaine
Nemo ? Pouvais−je enfin, de cette réunion de portraits, dégager le
mystère de son existence ? Était−il le champion des peuples opprimés, le
libérateur des races esclaves ? Avait−il figuré dans les dernières
commotions politiques ou sociales de ce siècle. Avait−il été l’un des héros
de la terrible guerre américaine, guerre lamentable et à jamais glorieuse ?
...
Tout à coup l’horloge sonna huit heures. Le battement du premier coup de
marteau sur le timbre m’arracha à mes rêves. Je tressaillis comme si un
oeil invisible eût pu plonger au plus secret de mes pensées, et je me
précipitai hors de la chambre.
Là, mes regards s’arrêtèrent sur la boussole. Notre direction était toujours
au nord. Le loch indiquait une vitesse modérée, le manomètre, une
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 331
profondeur de soixante pieds environ. Les circonstances favorisaient donc
les projets du Canadien.
Je regagnai ma chambre. Je me vêtis chaudement, bottes de mer, bonnet
de loutre, casaque de byssus doublée de peau de phoque. J’étais prêt.
J’attendis. Les frémissements de l’hélice troublaient seuls le silence
profond qui régnait à bord.J’écoutais, je tendais l’oreille. Quelque éclat
de voix ne m’apprendrait−il pas, tout à coup, que Ned Land venait d’être
surpris dans ses projets d’évasion ? Une inquiétude mortelle m’envahit.
J’essayai vainement de reprendre mon sang−froid.
A neuf heures moins quelques minutes, je collai mon oreille près de la
porte du capitaine. Nul bruit. Je quittai ma chambre, et je revins au salon
qui était plongé dans une demi−obscurité, mais désert.
J’ouvris la porte communiquant avec la bibliothèque. Même clarté
insuffisante, même solitude. J’allai me poster près de la porte qui donnait
sur la cage de l’escalier central. J’attendis le signal de Ned Land.
En ce moment, les frémissements de l’hélice diminuèrent sensiblement,
puis ils cessèrent tout à fait. Pourquoi ce changement dans les allures du
Nautilus ? Cette halte favorisait−elle ou gênait−elle les desseins de Ned
Land, je n’aurais pu le dire.
Le silence n’était plus troublé que par les battements de mon coeur.
Soudain, un léger choc se fit sentir. Je compris que le Nautilus venait de
s’arrêter sur le fond de l’océan. Mon inquiétude redoubla. Le signal du
Canadien ne m’arrivait pas. J’avais envie de rejoindre Ned Land pour
l’engager à remettre sa tentative. Je sentais que notre navigation ne se
faisait plus dans les conditions ordinaires...
En ce moment, la porte du grand salon s’ouvrit, et le capitaine Nemo
parut. Il m’aperçut, et, sans autre préambule :
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 332
« Ah ! Monsieur le professeur, dit−il d’un ton aimable, je vous cherchais.
Savez−vous votre histoire d’Espagne ? »
On saurait à fond l’histoire de son propre pays que, dans les conditions où
je me trouvais, l’esprit troublé, la tête perdue, on ne pourrait en citer un
mot.
« Eh bien ? reprit le capitaine Nemo, vous avez entendu ma question ?
Savez−vous l’histoire d’Espagne ?
— Très mal, répondis−je.
— Voilà bien les savants, dit le capitaine ils ne savent pas. Alors,
asseyez−vous, ajouta−t−il, et je vais vous raconter un curieux épisode de
cette histoire. »
Le capitaine s’étendit sur un divan, et, machinalement, je pris place auprès
de lui, dans la pénombre.
« Monsieur le professeur, me dit−il, écoutez−moi bien. Cette histoire vous
intéressera par un certain côté, car elle répondra à une question que sans
doute vous n’avez pu résoudre.
— Je vous écoute, capitaine, dis−je, ne sachant où mon interlocuteur
voulait en venir, et me demandant si cet incident se rapportait à nos
projets de fuite.
— Monsieur le professeur, reprit le capitaine Nemo, si vous le voulez bien,
nous remonterons à 1702. Vous n’ignorez pas qu’à cette époque, votre roi
Louis XIV, croyant qu’il suffisait d’un geste de potentat pour faire rentrer
les Pyrénées sous terre, avait imposé le duc d’Anjou, son petit−fils, aux
Espagnols. Ce prince, qui régna plus ou moins mal sous le nom de
Philippe V, eut affaire, au−dehors, à forte partie.
« En effet, l’année précédente, les maisons royales de Hollande,
d’Autriche et d’Angleterre, avaient conclu à la Haye un traité d’alliance,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 333
dans le but d’arracher la couronne d’Espagne à Philippe V, pour la placer
sur la tête d’un archiduc, auquel elles donnèrent prématurément le nom de
Charles III.
« L’Espagne dut résister à cette coalition. Mais elle était à peu près
dépourvue de soldats et de marins. Cependant, l’argent ne lui manquait
pas, à la condition toutefois que ses galions, chargés de l’or et de l’argent
de l’Amérique, entrassent dans ses ports. Or, vers la fin de 1702, elle
attendait un riche convoi que la France faisait escorter par une flotte de
vingt−trois vaisseaux commandés par l’amiral de Château−Renaud, car
les marines coalisées couraient alors l’Atlantique.
« Ce convoi devait se rendre à Cadix, mais l’amiral, ayant appris que la
flotte anglaise croisait dans ces parages, résolut de rallier un port de
France.
« Les commandants espagnols du convoi protestèrent contre cette
décision. Ils voulurent être conduits dans un port espagnol, et, à défaut de
Cadix, dans la baie de Vigo, située sur la côte nord−ouest de l’Espagne, et
qui n’était pas bloquée.
« L’amiral de Château−Renaud eut la faiblesse d’obéir à cette injonction,
et les galions entrèrent dans la baie de Vigo.
« Malheureusement cette baie forme une rade ouverte qui ne peut être
aucunement défendue. Il fallait donc se hâter de décharger les galions
avant l’arrivée des flottes coalisées, et le temps n’eût pas manqué à ce
débarquement, si une misérable question de rivalité n’eût surgi tout à
coup.
« Vous suivez bien l’enchaînement des faits ? me demanda le capitaine
Nemo.
— Parfaitement, dis−je, ne sachant encore à quel propos m’était faite
cette leçon d’histoire.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 334
— Je continue. Voici ce qui se passa. Les commerçants de Cadix avaient
un privilège d’après lequel ils devaient recevoir toutes les marchandises
qui venaient des Indes occidentales. Or, débarquer les lingots des galions
au port de Vigo, c’était aller contre leur droit. Ils se plaignirent donc à
Madrid, et ils obtinrent du faible Philippe V que le convoi, sans procéder à
son déchargement, resterait en séquestre dans la rade de Vigo jusqu’au
moment où les flottes ennemies se seraient éloignées.
« Or, pendant que l’on prenait cette décision, le 22 octobre 1702, les
vaisseaux anglais arrivèrent dans la baie de Vigo. L’amiral de
Château−Renaud, malgré ses forces inférieures, se battit courageusement.
Mais quand il vit que les richesses du convoi allaient tomber entre les
mains des ennemis, il incendia et saborda les galions qui s’engloutirent
avec leurs immenses trésors. »
Le capitaine Nemo s’était arrêté. Je l’avoue, je ne voyais pas encore en
quoi cette histoire pouvait m’intéresser.
« Eh bien ? Lui demandai−je.
— Eh bien, monsieur Aronnax, me répondit le capitaine Nemo, nous
sommes dans cette baie de Vigo, et il ne tient qu’à vous d’en pénétrer les
mystères. »
Le capitaine se leva et me pria de le suivre. J’avais eu le temps de me
remettre. J’obéis. Le salon était obscur, mais à travers les vitres
transparentes étincelaient les flots de la mer. Je regardai.
Autour du Nautilus, dans un rayon d’une demi−mille, les eaux
apparaissaient imprégnées de lumière électrique. Le fond sableux était net
et clair. Des hommes de l’équipage, revêtus de scaphandres, s’occupaient
à déblayer des tonneaux à demi pourris, des caisses éventrées, au milieu
d’épaves encore noircies. De ces caisses, de ces barils, s’échappaient des
lingots d’or et d’argent, des cascades de piastres et de bijoux. Le sable en
était jonché. Puis, chargés de ce précieux butin, ces hommes revenaient au
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La baie de Vigo 335
Nautilus, y déposaient leur fardeau et allaient reprendre cette inépuisable
pêche d’argent et d’or.
— En effet, dis−je. Aussi un bon avis à ces actionnaires serait−il acte de
charité. Qui sait pourtant s’il serait bien reçu. Ce que les joueurs
regrettent par−dessus tout, d’ordinaire, c’est moins la perte de leur argent
que celle de leurs folles espérances. Je les plains moins après tout que ces
milliers de malheureux auxquels tant de richesses bien réparties eussent
pu profiter, tandis qu’elles seront à jamais stériles pour eux ! »
Je n’avais pas plutôt exprimé ce regret que je sentis qu’il avait dû blesser
le capitaine Nemo.
« Stériles ! répondit−il en s’animant. Croyez−vous donc, monsieur, que
ces richesses soient perdues, alors que c’est moi qui les ramasse ? Est−ce
pour moi, selon vous, que je me donne la peine de recueillir ces trésors ?
Qui vous dit que je n’en fais pas un bon usage ? Croyez−vous que j’ignore
qu’il existe des êtres souffrants, des races opprimées sur cette terre, des
misérables à soulager, des victimes à venger ? Ne comprenez−vous pas ?
... »
Le capitaine Nemo s’arrêta sur ces dernières paroles, regrettant peut−être
d’avoir trop parlé. Mais j’avais deviné. Quels que fussent les motifs qui
l’avaient forcé à chercher l’indépendance sous les mers, avant tout il était
resté un homme ! Son coeur palpitait encore aux souffrances de
l’humanité, et son immense charité s’adressait aux races asservies comme
aux individus !
Et je compris alors à qui étaient destinés ces millions expédiés par le
capitaine Nemo, lorsque le Nautilus naviguait dans les eaux de la Crète
insurgée !
20 000 lieues sous les mers

Un continent disparu
Le lendemain matin, 19 février, je vis entrer le Canadien dans ma
chambre. J’attendais sa visite. Il avait l’air très désappointé.
« Eh bien, monsieur ? me dit−il.
— Oui ! il a fallu que ce damné capitaine s’arrêtât précisément à l’heure
ou nous allions fuir son bateau.
— Oui, Ned, il avait affaire chez son banquier.
— Son banquier !
— Ou plutôt sa maison de banque. J’entends par là cet Océan où ses
richesses sont plus en sûreté qu’elles ne le seraient dans les caisses d’un
État. »
Je racontai alors au Canadien les incidents de la veille, dans le secret
espoir de le ramener à l’idée de ne point abandonner le capitaine ; mais
mon récit n’eut d’autre résultat que le regret énergiquement exprimé par
Ned de n’avoir pu faire pour son compte une promenade sur le champ de
bataille de Vigo.
« Enfin, dit−il, tout n’est pas fini ! Ce n’est qu’un coup de harpon perdu !
Une autre fois nous réussirons, et dès ce soir s’il le faut...
— Quelle est la direction du Nautilus ? demandai−je.
— Je l’ignore, répondit Ned.
— Eh bien ! à midi, nous verrons le point. »
Un continent disparu 337
Le Canadien retourna près de Conseil. Dès que je fus habillé, je passai
dans le salon. Le compas n’était pas rassurant. La route du Nautilus était
sud−sud−ouest. Nous tournions le dos à l’Europe.
J’attendis avec une certaine impatience que le point fut reporté sur la
carte. Vers onze heures et demie, les réservoirs se vidèrent, et notre
appareil remonta à la surface de l’Océan. Je m’élançai vers la
plate−forme. Ned Land m’y avait précédé.
Plus de terres en vue. Rien que la mer immense. Quelques voiles à
l’horizon, de celles sans doute qui vont chercher jusqu’au cap San−Roque
les vents favorables pour doubler le cap de Bonne−Espérance. Le temps
était couvert. Un coup de vent se préparait.
Ned rageant, essayait de percer l’horizon brumeux. Il espérait encore que,
derrière tout ce brouillard, s’étendait cette terre si désirée.
A midi, le soleil se montra un instant. Le second profita de cette éclaircie
pour prendre sa hauteur. Puis, la mer devenant plus houleuse, nous
redescendîmes, et le panneau fut refermé.
Une heure après, lorsque je consultai la carte, je vis que la position du
Nautilus était indiquée par 16°17’de longitude et 33°22’de latitude, à cent
cinquante lieues de la côte la plus rapprochée. Il n’y avait pas moyen de
songer à fuir, et je laisse à penser quelles furent les colères du Canadien,
quand je lui fis connaître notre situation.
Pour mon compte, je ne me désolai pas outre mesure. Je me sentis comme
soulagé du poids qui m’oppressait, et je pus reprendre avec une sorte de
calme relatif mes travaux habituels.
Le soir, vers onze heures, je reçus la visite très inattendue du capitaine
Nemo. Il me demanda fort gracieusement si je me sentais fatigué d’avoir
veillé la nuit précédente. Je répondis négativement.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 338
« Alors, monsieur Aronnax, je vous proposerai une curieuse excursion.
— Proposez, capitaine.
— Vous n’avez encore visité les fonds sous−marins que le jour et sous la
clarté du soleil. Vous conviendrait−il de les voir par une nuit obscure ?
— Très volontiers.
— Cette promenade sera fatigante, je vous en préviens. Il faudra marcher
longtemps et gravir une montagne. Les chemins ne sont pas très bien
entretenus.
— Ce que vous me dites là, capitaine, redouble ma curiosité. Je suis prêt à
vous suivre.
— Venez donc, monsieur le professeur, nous allons revêtir nos
scaphandres. »
Arrivé au vestiaire, je vis que ni mes compagnons ni aucun homme de
l’équipage ne devait nous suivre pendant cette excursion. Le capitaine
Nemo ne m’avait pas même proposé d’emmener Ned ou Conseil.
En quelques instants, nous eûmes revêtu nos appareils. On plaça sur notre
dos les réservoirs abondamment chargés d’air, mais les lampes électriques
n’étaient pas préparées. Je le fis observer au capitaine.
« Elles nous seraient inutiles », répondit−il.
Je crus avoir mal entendu, mais je ne pus réitérer mon observation, car la
tête du capitaine avait déjà disparu dans son enveloppe métallique.
J’achevai de me harnacher, je sentis qu’on me plaçait dans la main un
bâton ferré, et quelques minutes plus tard, après la manoeuvre habituelle,
nous prenions pied sur le fond de l’Atlantique, à une profondeur de trois
cents mètres.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 339
Minuit approchait. Les eaux étaient profondément obscures, mais le
capitaine Nemo me montra dans le lointain un point rougeâtre, une sorte
de large lueur, qui brillait à deux milles environ du Nautilus. Ce qu’était
ce feu, quelles matières l’alimentaient, pourquoi et comment il se
revivifiait dans la masse liquide, je n’aurais pu le dire. En tout cas, il nous
éclairait, vaguement il est vrai, mais je m’accoutumai bientôt à ces
ténèbres particulières, et je compris, dans cette circonstance, l’inutilité des
appareils Ruhmkorff.
Le capitaine Nemo et moi, nous marchions l’un près de l’autre,
directement sur le feu signalé. Le sol plat montait insensiblement. Nous
faisions de larges enjambées, nous aidant du bâton ; mais notre marche
était lente, en somme, car nos pieds s’enfonçaient souvent dans une sorte
de vase pétrie avec des algues et semée de pierres plates.
Tout en avançant, j’entendais une sorte de grésillement au−dessus de ma
tête. Ce bruit redoublait parfois et produisait comme un pétillement
continu. J’en compris bientôt la cause. C’était la pluie qui tombait
violemment en crépitant à la surface des flots. Instinctivement, la pensée
me vint que j’allais être trempé ! Par l’eau, au milieu de l’eau ! Je ne pus
m’empêcher de rire à cette idée baroque. Mais pour tout dire, sous l’épais
habit du scaphandre, on ne sent plus le liquide élément, et l’on se croit au
milieu d’une atmosphère un peu plus dense que l’atmosphère terrestre,
voilà tout.
Après une demi−heure de marche, le sol devint rocailleux. Les méduses,
les crustacés microscopiques, les pennatules l’éclairaient légèrement de
lueurs phosphorescentes. J’entrevoyais des monceaux de pierres que
couvraient quelques millions de zoophytes et des fouillis d’algues. Le pied
me glissait souvent sur ces visqueux tapis de varech, et sans mon bâton
ferré, je serais tombé plus d’une fois. En me retournant, je voyais toujours
le fanal blanchâtre du Nautilus qui commençait à pâlir dans
l’éloignement.
Ces amoncellements pierreux dont je viens de parler étaient disposés sur
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 340
le fond océanique suivant une certaine régularité que je ne m’expliquais
pas. J’apercevais de gigantesques sillons qui se perdaient dans l’obscurité
lointaine et dont la longueur échappait à toute évaluation. D’autres
particularités se présentaient aussi, que je ne savais admettre. Il me
semblait que mes lourdes semelles de plomb écrasaient une litière
d’ossements qui craquaient avec un bruit sec. Qu’était donc cette vaste
plaine que je parcourais ainsi ? J’aurais voulu interroger le capitaine,
mais son langage par signes, qui lui permettait de causer avec ses
compagnons, lorsqu’ils le suivaient dans ses excursions sous−marines,
était encore incompréhensible pour moi. Cependant, la clarté rougeâtre
qui nous guidait, s’accroissait et enflammait l’horizon. La présence de ce
foyer sous les eaux m’intriguait au plus haut degré. Était−ce quelque
effluence électrique qui se manifestait ? Allais−je vers un phénomène
naturel encore inconnu des savants de la terre ? Ou même — car cette
pensée traversa mon cerveau — la main de l’homme intervenait−elle dans
cet embrasement ? Soufflait−elle cet incendie ? Devais−je rencontrer sous
ces couches profondes, des compagnons, des amis du capitaine Nemo,
vivant comme lui de cette existence étrange, et auxquels il allait rendre
visite ? Trouverais−je là−bas toute une colonie d’exilés, qui, las des
misères de la terre, avaient cherché et trouvé l’indépendance au plus
profond de l’Océan ? Toutes ces idées folles, inadmissibles, me
poursuivaient, et dans cette disposition d’esprit, surexcité sans cesse par la
série de merveilles qui passaient sous mes yeux, je n’aurais pas été surpris
de rencontrer, au fond de cette mer, une de ces villes sous−marines que
rêvait le capitaine Nemo !
Notre route s’éclairait de plus en plus. La lueur blanchissante rayonnait
au sommet d’une montagne haute de huit cents pieds environ. Mais ce que
j’apercevais n’était qu’une simple réverbération développée par le cristal
des couches d’eau. Le foyer, source de cette inexplicable darté, occupait le
versant opposé de la montagne.
Au milieu des dédales pierreux qui sillonnaient le fond de l’Atlantique, le
capitaine Nemo s’avançait sans hésitation. Il connaissait cette sombre
route. Il l’avait souvent parcourue, sans doute, et ne pouvait s’y perdre. Je
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 341
le suivais avec une confiance inébranlable. Il m’apparaissait comme un
des génies de la mer, et quand il marchait devant moi, j’admirais sa haute
stature qui se découpait en noir sur le fond lumineux de l’horizon.
Il était une heure du matin. Nous étions arrivés aux premières rampes de
la montagne. Mais pour les aborder, il fallut s’aventurer par les sentiers
difficiles d’un vaste taillis.
Oui ! un taillis d’arbres morts, sans feuilles, sans sève, arbres minéralisés
sous l’action des eaux, et que dominaient çà et là des pins gigantesques.
C’était comme une houillère encore debout, tenant par ses racines au sol
effondré, et dont la ramure, à la manière des fines découpures de papier
noir, se dessinait nettement sur le plafond des eaux. Que l’on se figure une
forêt du Hartz, accrochée aux flancs d’une montagne, mais une forêt
engloutie. Les sentiers étaient encombrés d’algues et de fucus, entre
lesquels grouillait un monde de crustacés. J’allais, gravissant les rocs,
enjambant les troncs étendus, brisant les lianes de mer qui se balançaient
d’un arbre à l’autre, effarouchant les poissons qui volaient de branche en
branche. Entraîné, je ne sentais plus la fatigue. Je suivais mon guide qui
ne se fatiguait pas.
Quel spectacle ! Comment le rendre ? Comment peindre l’aspect de ces
bois et de ces rochers dans ce milieu liquide, leurs dessous sombres et
farouches, leurs dessus colorés de tons rouges sous cette clarté que
doublait la puissance réverbérante des eaux ? Nous gravissions des rocs
qui s’éboulaient ensuite par pans énormes avec un sourd grondement
d’avalanche. A droite, à gauche, se creusaient de ténébreuses galeries où
se perdait le regard. Ici s’ouvraient de vastes clairières, que la main de
l’homme semblait avoir dégagées, et je me demandais parfois si quelque
habitant de ces régions sous−marines n’allait pas tout à coup
m’apparaître.
Mais le capitaine Nemo montait toujours. Je ne voulais pas rester en
arrière. Je le suivais hardiment. Mon bâton me prêtait un utile secours. Un
faux pas eût été dangereux sur ces étroites passes évidées aux flancs des
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 342
gouffres ; mais j’y marchais d’un pied ferme et sans ressentir l’ivresse du
vertige. Tantôt je sautais une crevasse dont la profondeur m’eût fait
reculer au milieu des glaciers de la terre ; tantôt je m’aventurais sur le
tronc vacillant des arbres jetés d’un abîme à l’autre, sans regarder sous
mes pieds, n’ayant des yeux que pour admirer les sites sauvages de cette
région. Là, des rocs monumentaux, penchant sur leurs bases
irrégulièrement découpées, semblaient défier les lois de l’équilibre. Entre
leurs genoux de pierre, des arbres poussaient comme un jet sous une
pression formidable, et soutenaient ceux qui les soutenaient eux−mêmes.
Puis, des tours naturelles, de larges pans taillés à pic comme des
courtines, s’inclinaient sous un angle que les lois de la gravitation
n’eussent pas autorisé à la surface des régions terrestres.
Et moi−même ne sentais−je pas cette différence due à la puissante densité
de l’eau, quand, malgré mes lourds vêtements, ma tête de cuivre, mes
semelles de métal, je m’élevais sur des pentes d’une impraticable raideur,
les franchissant pour ainsi dire avec la légèreté d’un isard ou d’un
chamois !
Au récit que je fais de cette excursion sous les eaux, je sens bien que je ne
pourrai être vraisemblable ! Je suis l’historien des choses d’apparence
impossible qui sont pourtant réelles, incontestables. Je n’ai point rêvé. J’ai
vu et senti !
Deux heures après avoir quitté le Nautilus, nous avions franchi la ligne
des arbres, et à cent pieds au−dessus de nos têtes se dressait le pic de la
montagne dont la projection faisait ombre sur l’éclatante irradiation du
versant opposé. Quelques arbrisseaux pétrifiés couraient çà et là en
zigzags grimaçants. Les poissons se levaient en masse sous nos pas comme
des oiseaux surpris dans les hautes herbes. La masse rocheuse était
creusée d’impénétrables anfractuosités, de grottes profondes,
d’insondables trous, au fond desquels j’entendais remuer des choses
formidables. Le sang me refluait jusqu’au coeur, quand j’apercevais une
antenne énorme qui me barrait la route, ou quelque pince effrayante se
refermant avec bruit dans l’ombre des cavités ! Des milliers de points
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 343
lumineux brillaient au milieu des ténèbres. C’étaient les yeux de crustacés
gigantesques, tapis dans leur tanière, des homards géants se redressant
comme des hallebardiers et remuant leurs pattes avec un cliquetis de
ferraille, des crabes titanesques, braqués comme des canons sur leurs
affûts, et des poulpes effroyables entrelaçant leurs tentacules comme une
broussaille vivante de serpents.
Quel était ce monde exorbitant que je ne connaissais pas encore ? A quel
ordre appartenaient ces articulés auxquels le roc formait comme une
seconde carapace ? Où la nature avait−elle trouvé le secret de leur
existence végétative, et depuis combien de siècles vivaient−ils ainsi dans
les dernières couches de l’Océan ?
Mais je ne pouvais m’arrêter. Le capitaine Nemo, familiarisé avec ces
terribles animaux, n’y prenait plus garde. Nous étions arrivés à un
premier plateau, ou d’autres surprises m’attendaient encore. Là se
dessinaient de pittoresques ruines, qui trahissaient la main de l’homme, et
non plus celle du Créateur. C’étaient de vastes amoncellements de pierres
où l’on distinguait de vagues formes de châteaux, de temples, revêtus d’un
monde de zoophytes en fleurs, et auxquels, au lieu de lierre, les algues et
les fucus faisaient un épais manteau végétal.
Mais qu’était donc cette portion du globe engloutie par les cataclysmes ?
Qui avait disposé ces roches et ces pierres comme des dolmens des temps
anté−historiques ? Où étais−je, où m’avait entraîné la fantaisie du
capitaine Nemo ?
J’aurais voulu l’interroger. Ne le pouvant, je l’arrêtai. Je saisis son bras.
Mais lui, secouant la tête, et me montrant le dernier sommet de la
montagne, sembla me dire :
« Viens ! viens encore ! viens toujours ! »
Je le suivis dans un dernier élan, et en quelques minutes, j’eus gravi le pic
qui dominait d’une dizaine de mètres toute cette masse rocheuse.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 344
Je regardai ce côté que nous venions de franchir. La montagne ne s’élevait
que de sept à huit cents pieds au−dessus de la plaine ; mais de son versant
opposé, elle dominait d’une hauteur double le fond en contre bas de cette
portion de l’Atlantique. Mes regards s’étendaient au loin et embrassaient
un vaste espace éclairé par une fulguration violente. En effet, c’était un
volcan que cette montagne. A cinquante pieds au−dessous du pic, au
milieu d’une pluie de pierres et de scories, un large cratère vomissait des
torrents de lave, qui se dispersaient en cascade de feu au sein de la masse
liquide. Ainsi posé, ce volcan, comme un immense flambeau, éclairait la
plaine inférieure jusqu’aux dernières limites de l’horizon.
J’ai dit que le cratère sous−marin rejetait des laves, mais non des
flammes. Il faut aux flammes l’oxygène de l’air, et elles ne sauraient se
développer sous les eaux ; mais des coulées de lave, qui ont en elles le
principe de leur incandescence, peuvent se porter au rouge blanc, lutter
victorieusement contre l’élément liquide et se vaporiser à son contact. De
rapides courants entraînaient tous ces gaz en diffusion, et les torrents
laviques glissaient jusqu’au bas de la montagne, comme les déjections du
Vésuve sur un autre Torre del Greco.
En effet, là, sous mes yeux, ruinée, abîmée, jetée bas, apparaissait une ville
détruite, ses toits effondrés, ses temples abattus, ses arcs disloqués, ses
colonnes gisant à terre, où l’on sentait encore les solides proportions
d’une sorte d’architecture toscane ; plus loin, quelques restes d’un
gigantesque aqueduc ; ici l’exhaussement empâté d’une acropole, avec les
formes flottantes d’un Parthénon ; là, des vestiges de quai, comme si
quelque antique port eût abrité jadis sur les bords d’un océan disparu les
vaisseaux marchands et les trirèmes de guerre ; plus loin encore, de
longues lignes de murailles écroulées, de larges rues désertes, toute une
Pompéi enfouie sous les eaux, que le capitaine Nemo ressuscitait à mes
regards !
Où étais−je ? Où étais−je ? Je voulais le savoir à tout prix, je voulais
parler, je voulais arracher la sphère de cuivre qui emprisonnait ma tête.
Mais le capitaine Nemo vint à moi et m’arrêta d’un geste. Puis, ramassant
un morceau de pierre crayeuse, il s’avança vers un roc de basalte noire et
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 345
traça ce seul mot :
ATLANTIDE
Quel éclair traversa mon esprit ! L’Atlantide, l’ancienne Méropide de
Théopompe, l’Atlantide de Platon, ce continent nié par Origène, Porphyre,
Jamblique, D’Anville, Malte−Brun, Humboldt, qui mettaient sa disparition
au compte des récits légendaires, admis par Possidonius, Pline,
Ammien−Marcellin, Tertullien, Engel, Sherer, Tournefort, Buffon,
d’Avezac, je l’avais là sous les yeux, portant encore les irrécusables
témoignages de sa catastrophe ! C’était donc cette région engloutie qui
existait en dehors de l’Europe, de l’Asie, de la Libye, au−delà des
colonnes d’Hercule, où vivait ce peuple puissant des Atlantes, contre
lequel se firent les premières guerres de l’ancienne Grèce !
L’historien qui a consigné dans ses écrits les hauts faits de ces temps
héroïques, c’est Platon lui−même. Son dialogue de Timée et de Critias a
été, pour ainsi dire, tracé sous l’inspiration de Solon, poète et législateur.
Un jour, Solon s’entretenait avec quelques sages vieillards de Saïs, ville
déjà vieille de huit cents ans, ainsi que le témoignaient ses annales gravées
sur le mur sacré de ses temples. L’un de ces vieillards raconta l’histoire
d’une autre ville plus ancienne de mille ans. Cette première cité
athénienne, âgée de neuf cents siècles, avait été envahie et en partie
détruite par les Atlantes. Ces Atlantes, disait−il, occupaient un continent
immense plus grand que l’Afrique et l’Asie réunies, qui couvrait une
surface comprise du douzième degré de latitude au quarantième degré
nord. Leur domination s’étendait même à l’Égypte. Ils voulurent l’imposer
jusqu’en Grèce, mais ils durent se retirer devant l’indomptable résistance
des Hellènes. Des siècles s’écoulèrent. Un cataclysme se produisit,
inondations, tremblements de terre. Une nuit et un jour suffirent à
l’anéantissement de cette Atlantide dont les plus hauts sommets, Madère,
les Açores, les Canaries, les îles du cap Vert, émergent encore.
Tels étaient ces souvenirs historiques que l’inscription du capitaine Nemo
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 346
faisait palpiter dans mon esprit. Ainsi donc, conduit par la plus étrange
destinée, je foulais du pied l’une des montagnes de ce continent ! Je
touchais de la main ces ruines mille fois séculaires et contemporaines des
époques géologiques ! Je marchais là même où avaient marché les
contemporains du premier homme ! J’écrasais sous mes lourdes semelles
ces squelettes d’animaux des temps fabuleux, que ces arbres, maintenant
minéralisés, couvraient autrefois de leur ombre !
Ah ! pourquoi le temps me manquait−il ! J’aurais voulu descendre les
pentes abruptes de cette montagne, parcourir en entier ce continent
immense qui sans doute reliait l’Afrique à l’Amérique, et visiter ces
grandes cités antédiluviennes. Là, peut−être, sous mes regards,
s’étendaient Makhimos, la guerrière, Eusebès, la pieuse, dont les
gigantesques habitants vivaient des siècles entiers, et auxquels la force ne
manquait pas pour entasser ces blocs qui résistaient encore à l’action des
eaux. Un jour peut−être, quelque phénomène éruptif les
ramènera à la surface des flots, ces ruines englouties ! On a signalé de
nombreux volcans sous−marins dans cette portion de l’Océan, et bien des
navires ont senti des secousses extraordinaires en passant sur ces fonds
tourmentés. Les uns ont entendu des bruits sourds qui annonçaient la lutte
des éléments ; les autres ont recueilli des cendres volcaniques projetées
hors de la mer. Tout ce sol jusqu’à l’Équateur est encore travaillé par les
forces plutoniennes. Et qui sait si, dans une époque éloignée, accrus par
les déjections volcaniques et par les couches successives de laves, des
sommets de montagnes ignivomes n’apparaîtront pas à la surface de
l’Atlantique !
Pendant que je rêvais ainsi, tandis que je cherchais à fixer dans mon
souvenir tous les détails de ce paysage grandiose, le capitaine Nemo,
accoudé sur une stèle moussue, demeurait immobile et comme pétrifié
dans une muette extase. Songeait−il à ces générations disparues et leur
demandait−il le secret de la destinée humaine ? Était−ce à cette place que
cet homme étrange venait se retremper dans les souvenirs de l’histoire, et
revivre de cette vie antique, lui qui ne voulait pas de la vie moderne ? Que
n’aurais−je donné pour connaître ses pensées, pour les partager, pour les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 347
comprendre !
Nous restâmes à cette place pendant une heure entière, contemplant la
vaste plaine sous l’éclat des laves qui prenaient parfois une intensité
surprenante. Les bouillonnements intérieurs faisaient courir de rapides
frissonnements sur l’écorce de la montagne. Des bruits profonds,
nettement transmis par ce milieu liquide, se répercutaient avec une
majestueuse ampleur.
En ce moment, la lune apparut un instant à travers la masse des eaux et
jeta quelques pâles rayons sur le continent englouti. Ce ne fut qu’une
lueur, mais d’un indescriptible effet. Le capitaine se leva, jeta un dernier
regard à cette immense plaine ; puis de la main il me fit signe de le suivre.
Nous descendîmes rapidement la montagne. La forêt minérale une fois
dépassée, j’aperçus le fanal du Nautilus qui brillait comme une étoile. Le
capitaine marcha droit à lui, et nous étions rentrés à bord au moment où
les premières teintes de l’aube blanchissaient la surface de l’Océan.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Un continent disparu 348
Les houilles sous−marines
Le lendemain, 20 février, je me réveillais fort tard. Les fatigues de la nuit
avaient prolongé mon sommeil jusqu’à onze heures. Je m’habillai
promptement. J’avais hâte de connaître la direction du Nautilus. Les
instruments m’indiquèrent qu’il courait toujours vers le sud avec une
vitesse de vingt milles à l’heure par une profondeur de cent mètres.
Conseil entra. Je lui racontai notre excursion nocturne, et, les panneaux
étant ouverts, il put encore entrevoir une partie de ce continent submergé.
En effet, le Nautilus rasait à dix mètres du sol seulement la plaine de
l’Atlantide. Il filait comme un ballon emporté par le vent au−dessus des
prairies terrestres ; mais il serait plus vrai de dire que nous étions dans ce
salon comme dans le wagon d’un train express. Les premiers plans qui
passaient devant nos yeux, c’étaient des rocs découpés fantastiquement,
des forêts d’arbres passés du règne végétal au règne animal, et dont
l’immobile silhouette grimaçait sous les flots. C’étaient aussi des masses
pierreuses enfouies sous des tapis d’axidies et d’anémones, hérissées de
longues hydrophytes verticales, puis des blocs de laves étrangement
contournés qui attestaient toute la fureur des expansions plutoniennes.
Tandis que ces sites bizarres resplendissaient sous nos feux électriques, je
racontais à Conseil l’histoire de ces Atlantes, qui, au point de vue
purement imaginaire, inspirèrent à Bailly tant de pages charmantes. Je lui
disais les guerres de ces peuples héroïques. Je discutais la question de
l’Atlantide en homme qui ne peut plus douter. Mais Conseil, distrait,
m’écoutait peu, et son indifférence à traiter ce point historique me fut
bientôt expliquée.
En effet, de nombreux poissons attiraient ses regards, et quand passaient
des poissons, Conseil, emporté dans les abîmes de la classification, sortait
du monde réel. Dans ce cas, je n’avais plus qu’à le suivre et à reprendre
Les houilles sous−marines 349
avec lui nos études ichtyologiques.
Du reste, ces poissons de l’Atlantique ne différaient pas sensiblement de
ceux que nous avions observés jusqu’ici. C’étaient des raies d’une taille
gigantesque, longues de cinq mètres et douées d’une grande force
musculaire qui leur permet de s’élancer au−dessus des flots, des squales
d’espèces diverses, entre autres, un glauque de quinze pieds, à dents
triangulaires et aiguës, que sa transparence rendait presque invisible au
milieu des eaux, des sagres bruns, des humantins en forme de prismes et
cuirassés d’une peau tuberculeuse, des esturgeons semblables à leurs
congénères de la Méditerranée, des syngnathes−trompettes, longs d’un
pied et demi, jaune−brun, pourvus de petites nageoires grises, sans dents
ni langue, et qui défilaient comme de fins et souples serpents.
Parmi les poissons osseux, Conseil nota des makairas noirâtres, longs de
trois mètres et armés à leur mâchoire supérieure d’une épée perçante, des
vives, aux couleurs animées, connues du temps d’Aristote sous le nom de
dragons marins et que les aiguillons de leur dorsale rendent très
dangereux à saisir, puis, des coryphèmes, au dos brun rayé de petites raies
bleues et encadré dans une bordure d’or, de belles dorades, des
chrysostones−lune, sortes de disques à reflets d’azur, qui, éclairés en
dessus par les rayons solaires, formaient comme des taches d’argent, enfin
des xyphias−espadons, longs de huit mètres, marchant par troupes,
portant des nageoires jaunâtres taillées en faux et de longs glaives de six
pieds, intrépides animaux, plutôt herbivores que piscivores, qui
obéissaient au moindre signe de leurs femelles comme des maris bien
stylés.
Mais tout en observant ces divers échantillons de la faune marine, je ne
laissais pas d’examiner les longues plaines de l’Atlantide. Parfois, de
capricieux accidents du sol obligeaient le Nautilus à ralentir sa vitesse, et
il se glissait alors avec l’adresse d’un cétacé dans d’étroits étranglements
de collines. Si ce labyrinthe devenait inextricable, l’appareil s’élevait
alors comme un aérostat, et l’obstacle franchi, il reprenait sa course
rapide à quelques mètres au−dessus du fond. Admirable et charmante
navigation, qui rappelait les manoeuvres d’une promenade aérostatique,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 350
avec cette différence toutefois que le Nautilus obéissait passivement à la
main de son timonier.
Vers quatre heures du soir, le terrain, généralement composé d’une vase
épaisse et entremêlée de branches minéralisées, se modifia peu à peu, il
devint plus rocailleux et parut semé de conglomérats, de tufs basaltiques,
avec quelques semis de laves et d’obsidiennes sulfureuses. Je pensai que la
région des montagnes allait bientôt succéder aux longues plaines, et, en
effet, dans certaines évolutions du Nautilus, j’aperçus l’horizon méridional
barré par une haute muraille qui semblait fermer toute issue. Son sommet
dépassait évidemment le niveau de l’Océan. Ce devait être un continent,
ou tout au moins une île, soit une des Canaries, soit une des îles du cap
Vert. Le point n’ayant pas été fait — à dessein peut−être — j’ignorais
notre position. En tout cas, une telle muraille me parut marquer la fin de
cette Atlantide, dont nous n’avions parcouru, en somme, qu’une minime
portion.
La nuit n’interrompit pas mes observations. J’étais resté seul. Conseil
avait regagné sa cabine. Le Nautilus, ralentissant son allure, voltigeait
au−dessus des masses confuses du sol, tantôt les effleurant comme s’il eût
voulu s’y poser, tantôt remontant capricieusement à la surface des flots.
J’entrevoyais alors quelques vives constellations à travers le cristal des
eaux, et précisément cinq ou six de ces étoiles zodiacales qui traînent à la
queue d’Orion.
Longtemps encore, je serais resté à ma vitre, admirant les beautés de la
mer et du ciel, quand les panneaux se refermèrent. A ce moment, le
Nautilus était arrivé à l’aplomb de la haute muraille. Comment
manoeuvrerait−il, je ne pouvais le deviner. Je regagnai ma chambre. Le
Nautilus ne bougeait plus. Je m’endormis avec la ferme intention de me
réveiller après quelques heures de sommeil.
Mais, le lendemain, il était huit heures lorsque je revins au salon. Je
regardai le manomètre. Il m’apprit que le Nautilus flottait à la surface de
l’Océan. J’entendais, d’ailleurs, un bruit de pas sur la plate−forme.
Cependant aucun roulis ne trahissait l’ondulation des lames supérieures.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 351
Je montai jusqu’au panneau. Il était ouvert. Mais, au lieu du grand jour
que j’attendais, je me vis environné d’une obscurité profonde. Où
étions−nous ? M’étais−je trompé ? Faisait−il encore nuit ? Non ! Pas une
étoile ne brillait, et la nuit n’a pas de ces ténèbres absolues.
Je ne savais que penser, quand une voix me dit :
« C’est vous, monsieur le professeur ?
— Ah ! capitaine Nemo, répondis−je, où sommes−nous ?
— Sous terre, monsieur le professeur.
— Sous terre ! m’écriai−je ! Et le Nautilus flotte encore ?
— Il flotte toujours.
— Mais, je ne comprends pas ?
— Attendez quelques instants. Notre fanal va s’allumer, et, si vous aimez
les situations claires, vous serez satisfait. »
Je mis le pied sur la plate−forme et j’attendis. L’obscurité était si
complète que je n’apercevais même pas le capitaine Nemo. Cependant, en
regardant au zénith, exactement au−dessus de ma tête, je crus saisir une
lueur indécise, une sorte de demi−jour qui emplissait un trou circulaire.
En ce moment, le fanal s’alluma soudain, et son vif éclat fit évanouir cette
vague lumière.
Je regardai, après avoir un instant fermé mes yeux éblouis par le jet
électrique. Le Nautilus était stationnaire. Il flottait auprès d’une berge
disposée comme un quai. Cette mer qui le supportait en ce moment, c’était
un lac emprisonné dans un cirque de murailles qui mesurait deux milles de
diamètre, soit six milles de tour. Son niveau, — le manomètre l’indiquait
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 352
— ne pouvait être que le niveau extérieur, car une communication existait
nécessairement entre ce lac et la mer. Les hautes parois, inclinées sur leur
base, s’arrondissaient en voûte et figuraient un immense entonnoir
retourné, dont la hauteur comptait cinq ou six cents mètres. Au sommet
s’ouvrait un orifice circulaire par lequel j’avais surpris cette légère clarté,
évidemment due au rayonnement diurne.
Avant d’examiner plus attentivement les dispositions intérieures de cette
énorme caverne, avant de me demander si c’était là l’ouvrage de la nature
ou de l’homme, j’allai vers le capitaine Nemo.
« Où sommes−nous ? dis−je.
— Au centre même d’un volcan éteint, me répondit le capitaine, un volcan
dont la mer a envahi l’intérieur à la suite de quelque convulsion du sol.
Pendant que vous dormiez, monsieur le professeur, le Nautilus a pénétré
dans ce lagon par un canal naturel ouvert à dix mètres au−dessous de la
surface de l’Océan. C’est ici son port d’attache, un port sûr, commode,
mystérieux, abrité de tous les rhumbs du vent ! Trouvez−moi sur les côtes
de vos continents ou de vos îles une rade qui vaille ce refuge assuré contre
la fureur des ouragans.
— En effet, répondis−je, ici vous êtes en sûreté, capitaine Nemo. Qui
pourrait vous atteindre au centre d’un volcan ? Mais, à son sommet,
n’ai−je pas aperçu une ouverture ?
— Oui, son cratère, un cratère empli jadis de laves, de vapeurs et de
flammes, et qui maintenant donne passage à cet air vivifiant que nous
respirons.
— Mais quelle est donc cette montagne volcanique ? demandai−je.
— Elle appartient à un des nombreux îlots dont cette mer est semée.
Simple écueil pour les navires, pour nous caverne immense. Le hasard me
l’a fait découvrir, et, en cela, le hasard m’a bien servi.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 353
— Mais ne pourrait−on descendre par cet orifice qui forme le cratère du
volcan ?
— Pas plus que je ne saurais y monter. Jusqu’à une centaine de pieds, la
base intérieure de cette montagne est praticable, mais au−dessus, les
parois surplombent, et leurs rampes ne pourraient être franchies.
— Je vois, capitaine, que la nature vous sert partout et toujours. Vous êtes
en sûreté sur ce lac, et nul que vous n’en peut visiter les eaux. Mais, à quoi
bon ce refuge ? Le Nautilus n’a pas besoin de port.
— Non, monsieur le professeur, mais il a besoin d’électricité pour se
mouvoir, d’éléments pour produire son électricité, de sodium pour
alimenter ses éléments, de charbon pour faire son sodium, et de houillères
pour extraire son charbon. Or, précisément ici, la mer recouvre des forêts
entières qui furent enlisées dans les temps géologiques ; minéralisées
maintenant et transformées en houille, elles sont pour moi une mine
inépuisable.
— Vos hommes, capitaine, font donc ici le métier de mineurs ?
— Précisément. Ces mines s’étendent sous les flots comme les houillères
de Newcastle. C’est ici que, revêtus du scaphandre, le pic et la pioche à la
main, mes hommes vont extraire cette houille, que je n’ai pas même
demandée aux mines de la terre. Lorsque je brûle ce combustible pour la
fabrication du sodium, la fumée qui s’échappe par le cratère de cette
montagne lui donne encore l’apparence d’un volcan en activité.
— Et nous les verrons à l’oeuvre, vos compagnons ?
— Non, pas cette fois, du moins, car je suis pressé de continuer notre tour
du monde sous−marin. Aussi, me contenterai−je de puiser aux réserves de
sodium que je possède. Le temps de les embarquer, c’est−à−dire un jour
seulement, et nous reprendrons notre voyage. Si donc vous voulez
parcourir cette caverne et faire le tour du lagon, profitez de cette journée,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 354
monsieur Aronnax. »
Je remerciai le capitaine, et j’allai chercher mes deux compagnons qui
n’avaient pas encore quitté leur cabine. Je les invitai à me suivre sans leur
dire où ils se trouvaient.
Ils montèrent sur la plate−forme. Conseil, qui ne s’étonnait de rien,
regarda comme une chose très naturelle de se réveiller sous une montagne
après s’être endormi sous les flots. Mais Ned Land n’eut d’autre idée que
de chercher si la caverne présentait quelque issue.
Après déjeuner, vers dix heures, nous descendions sur la berge.
« Nous voici donc encore une fois à terre, dit Conseil.
— Je n’appelle pas cela « la terre », répondit le Canadien. Et d’ailleurs,
nous ne sommes pas dessus, mais dessous. »
Entre le pied des parois de la montagne et les eaux du lac se développait
un rivage sablonneux qui, dans sa plus grande largeur, mesurait cinq
cents pieds. Sur cette grève, on pouvait faire aisément le tour du lac. Mais
la base des hautes parois formait un sol tourmenté, sur lequel gisaient,
dans un pittoresque entassement, des blocs volcaniques et d’énormes
pierres ponces. Toutes ces masses désagrégées, recouvertes d’un émail
poli sous l’action des feux souterrains, resplendissaient au contact des jets
électriques du fanal. La poussière micacée du rivage, que soulevaient nos
pas, s’envolait comme une nuée d’étincelles.
Le sol s’élevait sensiblement en s’éloignant du relais des flots, et nous
Mmes bientôt arrivés à des rampes longues et sinueuses, véritables
raidillons qui permettaient de s’élever peu à peu, mais il fallait marcher
prudemment au milieu de ces — conglomérats, qu’aucun ciment ne reliait
entre eux, et le pied glissait sur ces trachytes vitreux, faits de cristaux de
feldspath et de quartz.
La nature volcanique de cette énorme excavation s’affirmait de toutes
parts. Je le fis observer à mes compagnons.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 355
« Vous figurez−vous, leur demandai−je, ce que devait être cet entonnoir,
lorsqu’il s’emplissait de laves bouillonnantes, et que le niveau de ce
liquide incandescent s’élevait jusqu’à l’orifice de la montagne, comme la
fonte sur les parois d’un fourneau ?
— Je me le figure parfaitement, répondit Conseil. Mais monsieur me
dira−t−il pourquoi le grand fondeur a suspendu son opération, et
comment il se fait que la fournaise est remplacée par les eaux tranquilles
d’un lac ?
— Très probablement, Conseil, parce que quelque convulsion a produit
au−dessous de la surface de l’Océan cette ouverture qui a servi de
passage au Nautilus. Alors les eaux de l’Atlantique se sont précipitées à
l’intérieur de la montagne. Il y a eu lutte terrible entre les deux éléments,
lutte qui s’est terminée à l’avantage de Neptune. Mais bien des siècles se
sont écoulés depuis lors, et le volcan submergé s’est changé en grotte
paisible.
— Très bien, répliqua Ned Land. J’accepte l’explication, mais je regrette,
dans notre intérêt, que cette ouverture dont parle monsieur le professeur
ne soit pas produite au−dessus du niveau de la mer.
— Mais, ami Ned, répliqua Conseil, si ce passage n’eût pas été
sous−marin, le Nautilus n’aurait pu y pénétrer !
— Et j’ajouterai, maître Land, que les eaux ne se seraient pas précipitées
sous la montagne et que le volcan serait resté volcan. Donc vos regrets
sont superflus. »
Notre ascension continua. Les rampes se faisaient de plus en plus raides et
étroites. De profondes excavations les coupaient parfois, qu’il fallait
franchir. Des masses surplombantes voulaient être tournées. On se glissait
sur les genoux, on rampait sur le ventre. Mais, l’adresse de Conseil et la
force du Canadien aidant, tous les obstacles furent surmontés.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 356
A une hauteur de trente mètres environ, la nature du terrain se modifia,
sans qu’il devînt plus praticable. Aux conglomérats et aux trachytes
succédèrent de noirs basaltes ; ceux−ci étendus par nappes toutes
grumelées de soufflures ; ceux−là formant des prismes réguliers, disposés
comme une colonnade qui supportait les retombées de cette voûte
immense, admirable spécimen de l’architecture naturelle. Puis, entre ces
basaltes serpentaient de longues coulées de laves refroidies, incrustées de
raies bitumineuses, et, par places, s’étendaient de larges tapis de soufre.
Un jour plus puissant, entrant par le cratère supérieur, inondait d’une
vague clarté toutes ces déjections volcaniques, à jamais ensevelies au sein
de la montagne éteinte.
Cependant, notre marche ascensionnelle fut bientôt arrêtée, à une hauteur
de deux cent cinquante pieds environ, par d’infranchissables obstacles. La
voussure intérieure revenait en surplomb, et la montée dut se changer en
promenade circulaire. A ce dernier plan, le règne végétal commençait à
lutter avec le règne minéral. Quelques arbustes et même certains arbres
sortaient des anfractuosités de la paroi. Je reconnus des euphorhes qui
laissaient couler leur suc caustique. Des héliotropes, très inhabiles à
justifier leur nom, puisque les rayons solaires n’arrivaient jamais jusqu’à
eux, penchaient tristement leurs grappes de fleurs aux couleurs et aux
parfums à demi passés. Çà et là, quelques chrysanthèmes poussaient
timidement au pied d’aloès à longues feuilles tristes et maladifs. Mais,
entre les coulées de laves, j’aperçus de petites violettes, encore parfumées
d’une légère odeur, et j’avoue que je les respirai avec délices. Le parfum,
c’est l’âme de la fleur, et les fleurs de la mer, ces splendides hydrophytes,
n’ont pas d’âme !
Nous étions arrivés au pied d’un bouquet de dragonniers robustes, qui
écartaient les roches sous l’effort de leurs musculeuses racines, quand Ned
Land s’écria :
« Ah ! monsieur, une ruche !
— Une ruche ! répliquai−je, en faisant un geste de parfaite incrédulité.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 357
— Oui ! une ruche, répéta le Canadien, et des abeilles qui bourdonnent
autour. »
Je m’approchai et je dus me rendre à l’évidence. Il y avait là, à l’orifice
d’un trou creusé dans le trou d’un dragonnier, quelques milliers de ces
ingénieux insectes, si communs dans toutes les Canaries, et dont les
produits y sont particulièrement estimés.
Tout naturellement, le Canadien voulut faire sa provision de miel, et
j’aurais eu mauvaise grâce à m’y opposer. Une certaine quantité de
feuilles sèches mélangées de soufre s’allumèrent sous l’étincelle de son
briquet, et il commença à enfumer les abeilles. Les bourdonnements
cessèrent peu à peu, et la ruche éventrée livra plusieurs livres d’un miel
parfumé. Ned Land en remplit son havresac.
« Quand j’aurai mélangé ce miel avec la pâte de l’artocarpus, nous dit−il,
je serai en mesure de vous offrir un gâteau succulent.
— Parbleu ! fit Conseil, ce sera du pain d’épice.
— Va pour le pain d’épice, dis−je, mais reprenons cette intéressante
promenade. »
A certains détours du sentier que nous suivions alots, le lac apparaissait
dans toute son étendue. Le fanal éclairait en entier sa surface paisible qui
ne connaissait ni les rides ni les ondulations. Le Nautilus gardait une
immobilité parfaite. Sur sa plate−forme et sur la berge s’agitaient les
hommes de son équipage, ombres noires nettement découpées au milieu de
cette lumineuse atmosphère.
En ce moment, nous contournions la crête la plus élevée de ces premiers
plans de roches qui soutenaient la voûte. Je vis alors que les abeilles
n’étaient pas les seuls représentants du règne animal à l’intérieur de ce
volcan. Des oiseaux de proie planaient et tournoyaient çà et là dans
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 358
l’ombre, ou s’enfuyaient de leurs nids perchés sur des pointes de roc.
C’étaient des éperviers au ventre blanc, et des crécelles criardes. Sur les
pentes détalaient aussi, de toute la rapidité de leurs échasses, de belles et
grasses outardes. Je laisse à penser si la convoitise du Canadien fut
allumée à la vue de ce gibier savoureux, et s’il regretta de ne pas avoir un
fusil entre ses mains. Il essaya de remplacer le plomb par les pierres, et
après plusieurs essais infructueux, il parvint à blesser une de ces
magnifiques outardes. Dire qu’il risqua vingt fois sa vie pour s’en
emparer, ce n’est que vérité pure, mais il fit si bien que l’animal alla
rejoindre dans son sac les gâteaux de miel.
Nous dûmes alors redescendre vers le rivage, car la crête devenait
impraticable. Au−dessus de nous, le cratère béant apparaissait comme
une large ouverture de puits. De cette place, le ciel se laissait distinguer
assez nettement, et je voyais courir des nuages échevelés par le vent
d’ouest, qui laissaient traîner jusqu’au sommet de la montagne leurs
brumeux haillons. Preuve certaine que ces nuages se tenaient à une
hauteur médiocre, car le volcan ne s’élevait pas à plus de huit cents pieds
au−dessus du niveau de l’Océan.
Une demi−heure après le dernier exploit du Canadien nous avions
regagné le rivage intérieur. Ici, la flore était représentée par de larges
tapis de cette criste−marine, petite plante ombellifère très bonne à confire,
qui porte aussi les noms de perce−pierre, de passe−pierre et de
fenouil−marin. Conseil en récolta quelques bottes. Quant à la faune, elle
comptait pas milliers des crustacés de toutes sortes, des homards, des
crabes−tourteaux, des palémons, des mysis, des faucheurs, des galatées et
un nombre prodigieux de coquillages, porcelaines, rochers et patelles.
En cet endroit s’ouvrait une magnifique grotte. Mes compagnons et moi
nous prîmes plaisir à nous étendre sur son sable fin. Le feu avait poli ses
parois émaillées et étincelantes, toutes saupoudrées de la poussière du
mica. Ned Land en tâtait les murailles et cherchait à sonder leur
épaisseur. Je ne pus m’empêcher de sourire. La conversation se mit alors
sur ses éternels projets d’évasion, et je crus pouvoir, sans trop m’avancer,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 359
lui donner cette espérance : c’est que le capitaine Nemo n’était descendu
au sud que pour renouveler sa provision de sodium. J’espérais donc que,
maintenant, il rallierait les côtes de l’Europe et de l’Amérique ; ce qui
permettrait au Canadien de reprendre avec plus de succès sa tentative
avortée.
Nous étions étendus depuis une heure dans cette grotte charmante. La
conversation, animée au début, languissait alors. Une certaine somnolence
s’emparait de nous. Comme je ne voyais aucune raison de résister au
sommeil, je me laissai aller à un assoupissement profond. Je rêvais — on
ne choisit pas ses rêves — je rêvais que mon existence se réduisait à la vie
végétative d’un simple mollusque. Il me semblait que cette grotte formait
la double valve de ma coquille...
Tout d’un coup, je fus réveillé par la voix de Conseil.
« Alerte ! Alerte ! criait ce digne garçon.
— Qu’y a−t−il ? demandai−je, me soulevant à demi.
— L’eau nous gagne ! »
Je me redressai. La mer se précipitait comme un torrent dans notre
retraite, et, décidément, puisque nous n’étions pas des mollusques, il fallait
se sauver.
En quelques instants, nous fûmes en sûreté sur le sommet de la grotte
même.
« Que se passe−t−il donc ? demanda Conseil. Quelque nouveau
phénomène ?
— Eh non ! mes amis, répondis−je, c’est la marée, ce n’est que la marée
qui a failli nous surprendre comme le héros de Walter Scott ! L’Océan se
gonfle au−dehors, et par une loi toute naturelle d’équilibre, le niveau du
lac monte également. Nous en sommes quittes pour un demi−bain. Allons
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 360
nous changer au Nautilus. »
Trois quarts d’heure plus tard, nous avions achevé notre promenade
circulaire et nous rentrions à bord. Les hommes de l’équipage achevaient
en ce moment d’embarquer les provisions de sodium, et le Nautilus aurait
pu partir à l’instant.
Cependant, le capitaine Nemo ne donna aucun ordre. Voulait−il attendre
la nuit et sortir secrètement par son passage sous−marin ? Peut−être.
Quoi qu’il en soit, le lendemain, le Nautilus, ayant quitté son port
d’attache, naviguait au large de toute terre, et à quelques mètres
au−dessous des flots de l’Atlantique.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les houilles sous−marines 361
La mer de Sargasses
La direction du Nautilus ne s’était pas modifiée. Tout espoir de revenir
vers les mers européennes devait donc être momentanément rejeté. Le
capitaine Nemo maintenait le cap vers le sud. Où nous entraînait−il ? Je
n’osais l’imaginer.
Ce jour−là, le Nautilus traversa une singulière portion de l’Océan
atlantique. Personne n’ignore l’existence de ce grand courant d’eau
chaude connu sous le nom de Gulf Stream. Après être sorti des canaux de
Floride il se dirige vers le Spitzberg. Mais avant de pénétrer dans le golfe
du Mexique, vers le quarante−quatrième degré de latitude nord, ce
courant se divise en deux bras ; le principal se porte vers les côtes
d’Irlande et de Norvège, tandis que le second fléchit vers le sud à la
hauteur des Acores ; puis frappant les rivages africains et décrivant un
ovale allongé, il revient vers les Antilles.
Or, ce second bras — c’est plutôt un collier qu’un bras — entoure de ses
anneaux d’eau chaude cette portion de l’Océan froide, tranquille,
immobile, que l’on appelle la mer de Sargasses. Véritable lac en plein
Atlantique, les eaux du grand courant ne mettent pas moins de trois ans à
en faire le tour.
La mer de Sargasses, à proprement parler, couvre toute la partie
immergée de l’Atlantide. Certains auteurs ont même admis que ces
nombreuses herbes dont elle est semée sont arrachées aux prairies de cet
ancien continent. Il est plus probable, cependant, que ces herbages, algues
et fucus, enlevés au rivage de l’Europe et de l’Amérique, sont entraînés
jusqu’à cette zone par le Gulf Stream. Ce fut là une des raisons qui
amenèrent Colomb à supposer l’existence d’un nouveau monde. Lorsque
les navires de ce hardi chercheur arrivèrent à la mer de Sargasses, ils
naviguèrent non sans peine au milieu de ces herbes qui arrêtaient leur
La mer de Sargasses 362
marche au grand effroi des équipages, et ils perdirent trois longues
semaines à les traverser.
Telle était cette région que le Nautilus visitait en ce moment, une prairie
véritable, un tapis serré d’algues, de fucus natans, de raisins du tropique,
si épais, si compact, que l’étrave d’un bâtiment ne l’eût pas déchiré sans
peine. Aussi, le capitaine Nemo, ne voulant pas engager son hélice dans
cette masse herbeuse, se tint−il à quelques mètres de profondeur
au−dessous de la surface des flots.
Ce nom de Sargasses vient du mot espagnol « sargazzo » qui signifie
varech. Ce varech, le varech−nageur ou porte−baie, forme principalement
ce banc immense. Et voici pourquoi, suivant le savant Maury, l’auteur de
la Géographie physique du globe, ces hydrophytes se réunissent dans ce
paisible bassin de l’Atlantique :
« L’explication qu’on en peut donner, dit−il, me semble résulter d’une
expérience connue de tout le monde. Si l’on place dans un vase des
fragments de bouchons ou de corps flottants quelconques, et que l’on
imprime à l’eau de ce vase un mouvement circulaire, on verra les
fragments éparpillés se réunir en groupe au centre de la surface liquide,
c’est−à−dire au point le moins agité. Dans le phénomène qui nous occupe,
le vase, c’est l’Atlantique, le Gulf Stream, c’est le courant circulaire, et la
mer de Sargasses, le point central où viennent se réunir les corps flottants.
»
Je partage l’opinion de Maury, et j’ai pu étudier le phénomène dans ce
milieu spécial où les navires pénètrent rarement. Au−dessus de nous
flottaient des corps de toute provenance, entassés au milieu de ces herbes
brunâtres, des troncs d’arbres arrachés aux Andes ou aux
Montagnes−Rocheuses et flottés par l’Amazone ou le Mississipi, de
nombreuses épaves, des restes de quilles ou de carènes, des bordages
défoncés et tellement alourdis par les coquilles et les anatifes qu’ils ne
pouvaient remonter à la surface de l’Océan. Et le temps justifiera un jour
cette autre opinion de Maury, que ces matières, ainsi accumulées pendant
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 363
des siècles, se minéraliseront sous l’action des eaux et formeront alors
d’inépuisables houillères. Réserve précieuse que prépare la prévoyante
nature pour ce moment où les hommes auront épuisé les mines des
continents.
Au milieu de cet inextricable tissu d’herbes et de fucus, je remarquai de
charmants alcyons stellés aux couleurs roses, des actinies qui laissaient
traîner leur longue chevelure de tentacules, des méduses vertes, rouges,
bleues, et particulièrement ces grandes rhizostomes de Cuvier, dont
l’ombrelle bleuâtre est bordée d’un feston violet.
Toute cette journée du 22 février se passa dans la mer de Sargasses, où les
poissons, amateurs de plantes marines et de crustacés, trouvent une
abondante nourriture. Le lendemain, l’Océan avait repris son aspect
accoutume.
Depuis ce moment, pendant dix−neuf jours, du 23 février au 12 mars, le
Nautilus, tenant le milieu de l’Atlantique, nous emporta avec une vitesse
constante de cent lieues par vingt−quatre heures. Le capitaine Nemo
voulait évidemment accomplir son programme sous−marin et je ne doutais
pas qu’il ne songeât, après avoir doublé le cap Horn, à revenir vers les
mers australes du Pacifique.
Ned Land avait donc eu raison de craindre. Dans ces larges mers, privées
d’îles, il ne fallait plus tenter de quitter le bord. Nul moyen non plus de
s’opposer aux volontés du capitaine Nemo. Le seul parti était de se
soumettre ; mais ce qu’on ne devait plus attendre de la force ou de la ruse,
j’aimais à penser qu’on pourrait l’obtenir par la persuasion. Ce voyage
terminé, le capitaine Nemo ne consentirait−il pas à nous rendre la liberté
sous serment de ne jamais révéler son existence ? Serment d’honneur que
nous aurions tenu. Mais il fallait traiter cette délicate question avec le
capitaine. Or, serais−je bien venu à réclamer cette liberté ? Lui−même
n’avait−il pas déclaré, dès le début et d’une façon formelle, que le secret
de sa vie exigeait notre emprisonnement perpétuel à bord du Nautilus ?
Mon silence, depuis quatre mois, ne devait−il pas lui paraître une
acceptation tacite de cette situation ? Revenir sur ce sujet n’aurait−il pas
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 364
pour résultat de donner des soupçons qui pourraient nuire à nos projets, si
quelque circonstance favorable se présentait plus tard de les reprendre ?
Toutes ces raisons, je les pesais, je les retournais dans mon esprit, je les
soumettais à Conseil qui n’était pas moins embarrassé que moi. En
somme, bien que je ne fusse pas facile à décourager, je comprenais que les
chances de jamais revoir mes semblables diminuaient de jour en jour,
surtout en ce moment où le capitaine Nemo courait en téméraire vers le
sud de l’Atlantique !
Pendant les dix−neuf jours que j’ai mentionnés plus haut, aucun incident
particulier ne signala notre voyage. Je vis peu le capitaine. Il travaillait.
Dans la bibliothèque je trouvais souvent des livres qu’il laissait
entr’ouverts, et surtout des livres d’histoire naturelle. Mon ouvrage sur les
fonds sous−marins, feuilleté par lui, était couvert de notes en marge, qui
contredisaient parfois mes théories et mes systèmes. Mais le capitaine se
contentait d’épurer ainsi mon travail, et il était rare qu’il discutât avec
moi. Quelquefois, j’entendais résonner les sons mélancoliques de son
orgue, dont il jouait avec beaucoup d’expression, mais la nuit seulement,
au milieu de la plus secrète obscurité, lorsque le Nautilus s’endormait
dans les déserts de l’Océan.
Pendant cette partie du voyage, nous naviguâmes des journées entières à
la surface des flots. La mer était comme abandonnée. A peine quelques
navires à voiles, en charge pour les Indes, se dirigeant vers le cap de
Bonne−Espérance. Un jour nous fûmes poursuivis par les embarcations
d’un baleinier qui nous prenait sans doute pour quelque énorme baleine
d’un haut prix. Mais le capitaine Nemo ne voulut pas faire perdre à ces
braves gens leur temps et leurs peines, et il termina la chasse en plongeant
sous les eaux. Cet incident avait paru vivement intéresser Ned Land. Je ne
crois pas me tromper en disant que le Canadien avait dû regretter que
notre cétacé de tôle ne pût être frappé à mort par le harpon de ces
pêcheurs.
Les poissons observés par Conseil et par moi, pendant cette période,
différaient peu de ceux que nous avions déjà étudiés sous d’autres
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 365
latitudes. Les principaux furent quelques échantillons de ce terrible genre
de cartilagineux, divisé en trois sous−genres qui ne comptent pas moins de
trente−deux espèces : des squales−galonnés, longs de cinq mètres, à tête
déprimée et plus large que le corps, à nageoire caudale arrondie, et dont
le dos porte sept grandes bandes noires parallèles et longitudinales puis
des squales−perlons, gris cendré, percés de sept ouvertures branchiales et
pourvus d’une seule nageoire dorsale placée à peu près vers le milieu du
corps.
Passaient aussi de grands chiens de mer, poissons voraces s’il en fut. On a
le droit de ne point croire aux récits des pêcheurs, mais voici ce qu’ils
racontent. On a trouvé dans le corps de l’un de ces animaux une tête de
buffle et un veau tout entier ; dans un autre, deux thons et un matelot en
uniforme ; dans un autre, un soldat avec son sabre ; dans un autre enfin,
un cheval avec son cavalier. Tout ceci, à vrai dire, n’est pas article de foi.
Toujours est−il qu’aucun de ces animaux ne se laissa prendre aux filets du
Nautilus, et que je ne pus vérifier leur voracité.
Des troupes élégantes et folâtres de dauphins nous accompagnèrent
pendant des jours entiers. Ils allaient par bandes de cinq ou six, chassant
en meute comme les loups dans les campagnes d’ailleurs, non moins
voraces que les chiens de mer, si j’en crois un professeur de Copenhague,
qui retira de l’estomac d’un dauphin treize marsouins et quinze phoques.
C’était, il est vrai un épaulard, appartenant à la plus grande espèce
connue, et dont la longueur dépasse quelquefois vingt−quatre pieds. Cette
famille des delphiniens compte dix genres, et ceux que j’aperçus tenaient
du genre des delphinorinques, remarquables par un museau excessivement
étroit et quatre fois long comme le crâne. Leur corps, mesurant trois
mètres, noir en dessus, était en dessous d’un blanc rosé semé de petites
taches très rares.
Je citerai aussi, dans ces mers, de curieux échantillons de ces poissons de
l’ordre des acanthoptérigiens et de la famille des sciénoides. Quelques
auteurs — plus poètes que naturalistes — prétendent que ces poissons
chantent mélodieusement, et que leurs voix réunies forment un concert
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 366
qu’un choeur de voix humaines ne saurait égaler. Je ne dis pas non, mais
ces scènes ne nous donnèrent aucune sérénade à notre passage, et je le
regrette.
Pour terminer enfin, Conseil classa une grande quantité de poissons
volants. Rien n’était plus curieux que de voir les dauphins leur donner la
chasse avec une précision merveilleuse. Quelle que fût la portée de son
vol, quelque trajectoire qu’il décrivît, même au−dessus du Nautilus,
l’infortuné poisson trouvait toujours la bouche du dauphin ouverte pour le
recevoir. C’étaient ou des pirapèdes, ou des trigles−milans, à bouche
lumineuse, qui, pendant la nuit, après avoir tracé des raies de feu dans
l’atmosphère, plongeaient dans les eaux sombres comme autant d’étoiles
filantes.
Jusqu’au 13 mars, notre navigation se continua dans ces conditions. Ce
jour−là, le Nautilus fut employé à des expériences de sondages qui
m’intéressèrent vivement.
Nous avions fait alors près de treize mille lieues depuis notre départ dans
les hautes mers du Pacifique. Le point nous mettait par 450°37’de latitude
sud et 370°53’de longitude ouest. C’étaient ces mêmes parages où le
capitaine Denham de l’Hérald fila quatorze mille mètres de sonde sans
trouver de fond. Là aussi, le lieutenant Parcker de la frégate américaine
Congress n’avait pu atteindre le sol sous−marin par quinze mille cent
quarante mètres.
Le capitaine Nemo résolut d’envoyer son Nautilus à la plus extrême
profondeur à fin de contrôler ces différents sondages. Je me préparai à
noter tous les résultats de l’expérience. Les panneaux du salon furent
ouverts, et les manoeuvres commencèrent pour atteindre ces couches si
prodigieusement reculées. On pense bien qu’il ne fut pas question de
plonger en remplissant les réservoirs. Peut−être n’eussent−ils pu
accroître suffisamment la pesanteur spécifique du Nautilus. D’ailleurs,
pour remonter, il aurait fallu chasser cette surcharge d’eau, et les pompes
n’auraient pas été assez puissantes pour vaincre la pression extérieure. Le
capitaine Nemo résolut d’aller chercher le fond océanique par une
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 367
diagonale suffisamment allongée, au moyen de ses plans latéraux qui
furent placés sous un angle de quarante−cinq degrés avec les lignes d’eau
du Nautilus. Puis, l’hélice fut portée à son maximum de vitesse, et sa
quadruple branche battit les flots avec une indescriptible violence.
Sous cette poussée puissante, la coque du Nautilus frémit comme une
corde sonore et s’enfonça régulièrement sous les eaux. Le capitaine et
moi, postés dans le salon, nous suivions l’aiguille du manomètre qui
déviait rapidement. Bientôt fut dépassée cette zone habitable où résident la
plupart des poissons. Si quelques−uns de ces animaux ne peuvent vivre
qu’à la surface des mers ou des fleuves, d’autres, moins nombreux, se
tiennent à des profondeurs assez grandes. Parmi ces derniers, j’observais
l’hexanche, espèce de chien de mer muni de six fentes respiratoires, le
télescope aux yeux énormes, le malarmat−cuirassé, aux thoracines grises,
aux pectorales noires, que protégeait son plastron de plaques osseuses
d’un rouge pâle, puis enfin le grenadier, qui, vivant par douze cents mètres
de profondeur, supportait alors une pression de cent vingt atmosphères.
Je demandai au capitaine Nemo s’il avait observé des poissons à des
profondeurs plus considérables.
« Des poissons ? me répondit−il, rarement. Mais dans l’état actuel de la
science, que présume−t−on, que sait−on ?
— Le voici, capitaine. On sait que en allant vers les basses couches de
l’Océan, la vie végétale disparaît plus vite que la vie animale. On sait que,
là où se rencontrent encore des êtres animés, ne végète plus une seule
hydrophyte. On sait que les pèlerines, les huîtres vivent par deux mille
mètres d’eau, et que Mac Clintock, le héros des mers polaires, a retiré une
étoile vivante d’une profondeur de deux mille cinq cents mètres. On sait
que l’équipage du Bull−Dog, de la Marine Royale, a pêché une astérie par
deux mille six cent vingt brasses, soit plus d’une lieue de profondeur.
Mais, capitaine Nemo, peut−être me direz−vous qu’on ne sait rien ?
— Non, monsieur le professeur, répondit le capitaine, je n’aurai pas cette
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 368
impolitesse. Toutefois, je vous demanderai comment vous expliquez que
des êtres puissent vivre à de telles profondeurs ?
— Je l’explique par deux raisons, répondis−je. D’abord, parce que les
courants verticaux, déterminés par les différences de salure et de densité
des eaux, produisent un mouvement qui suffit à entretenir la vie
rudimentaire des encrines et des astéries.
— Juste, fit le capitaine.
— Ensuite, parce que, si l’oxygène est la base de la vie, on sait que la
quantité d’oxygène dissous dans l’eau de mer augmente avec la
profondeur au lieu de diminuer. et que la pression des couches basses
contribue à l’y comprimer.
— Ah ! on sait cela ? répondit le capitaine Nemo, d’un ton légèrement
surpris. Eh bien, monsieur le professeur, on a raison de le savoir, car c’est
la vérité. J’ajouterai, en effet, que la vessie natatoire des poissons
renferme plus d’azote que d’oxygène, quand ces animaux sont pêchés à la
surface des eaux, et plus d’oxygène que d’azote, au contraire, quand ils
sont tirés des grandes profondeurs. Ce qui donne raison à votre système.
Mais continuons nos observations. »
Mes regards se reportèrent sur le manomètre. L’instrument indiquait une
profondeur de six mille mètres. Notre immersion durait depuis une heure.
Le Nautilus, glissant sur ses plans inclinés, s’enfonçait toujours. Les eaux
désertes étaient admirablement transparentes et d’une diaphanité que rien
ne saurait peindre. Une heure plus tard, nous étions par treize mille mètres
— trois lieues et quart environ — et le fond de l’Océan ne se laissait pas
pressentir.
Cependant, par quatorze mille mètres, j’aperçus des pics noirâtres qui
surgissaient au milieu des eaux. Mais ces sommets pouvaient appartenir à
des montagnes hautes comme l’Hymalaya ou le Mont−Blanc, plus hautes
même, et la profondeur de ces abîmes demeurait inévaluable.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 369
Le Nautilus descendit plus bas encore, malgré les puissantes pressions
qu’il subissait. Je sentais ses tôles trembler sous la jointure de leurs
boulons ; ses barreaux s’arquaient ; ses cloisons gémissaient ; les vitres
du salon semblaient se gondoler sous la pression des eaux. Et ce solide
appareil eût cédé sans doute. si, ainsi que l’avait dit son capitaine, il n’eût
été capable de résister comme un bloc plein.
En rasant les pentes de ces roches perdues sous les eaux, j’apercevais
encore quelques coquilles, des serpuls, des spinorbis vivantes, et certains
échantillons d’astéries.
Mais bientôt ces derniers représentants de la vie animale disparurent, et,
au−dessous de trois lieues, le Nautilus dépassa les limites de l’existence
sous−marine, comme fait le ballon qui s’élève dans les airs au−dessus des
zones respirables. Nous avions atteint une profondeur de seize mille
mètres — quatre lieues — et les flancs du Nautilus supportaient alors une
pression de seize cents atmosphères, c’est−à−dire seize cents kilogrammes
par chaque centimètre carré de sa surface !
« Quelle situation ! m’écriai−je. Parcourir dans ces régions profondes où
l’homme n’est jamais parvenu ! Voyez, capitaine, voyez ces rocs
magnifiques, ces grottes inhabitées, ces derniers réceptacles du globe, où
la vie n’est plus possible ! Quels sites inconnus et pourquoi faut−il que
nous soyons réduits à n’en conserver que le souvenir ?
— Vous plairait−il, me demanda le capitaine Nemo, d’en rapporter mieux
que le souvenir ?
— Que voulez−vous dire par ces paroles ?
— Je veux dire que rien n’est plus facile que de prendre une vue
photographique de cette régions sous−marine ! »
Je n’avais pas eu le temps d’exprimer la surprise que me causait cette
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 370
nouvelle proposition, que sur un appel du capitaine Nemo, un objectif était
apporté dans le salon. Par les panneaux largement ouverts, le milieu
liquide éclairé électriquement, se distribuait avec une clarté parfaite.
Nulle ombre, nulle dégradation de notre lumière factice. Le soleil n’eût
pas été plus favorable à une opération de cette nature. Le Nautilus, sous la
poussée de son hélice, maîtrisée par l’inclinaison de ses plans, demeurait
immobile. L’instrument fut braqué sur ces sites du fond océanique, et en
quelques secondes. nous avions obtenu un négatif d’une extrême pureté.
C’est l’épreuve positive que j’en donne ici. On y voit ces roches
primordiales qui n’ont jamais connu la lumière des cieux, ces granits
inférieurs qui forment la puissante assise du globe, ces grottes profondes
évidées dans la masse pierreuse, ces profils d’une incomparable netteté et
dont le trait terminal se détache en noir, comme s’il était dû au pinceau de
certains artistes flamands. Puis, au−delà, un horizon de montagnes, une
admirable ligne ondulée qui compose les arrière−plans du paysage. Je ne
puis décrire cet ensemble de roches lisses. noires, polies, sans une mousse,
sans une tache, aux formes étrangement découpées et solidement établies
sur ce tapis de sable qui étincelait sous les jets de la lumière électrique.
Cependant, le capitaine Nemo, après avoir terminé son opération, m’avait
dit :
« Remontons monsieur le professeur. Il ne faut pas abuser de cette
situation ni exposer trop longtemps le Nautilus à de pareilles pressions.
— Remontons ! répondis−je.
— Tenez−vous bien. »
Je n’avais pas encore eu le temps de comprendre pourquoi le capitaine me
faisait cette recommandation, quand je fus précipité sur le tapis.
Son hélice embrayée sur un signal du capitaine, ses plans dressés
verticalement, le Nautilus, emporté comme un ballon dans les airs,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 371
s’enlevait avec une rapidité foudroyante. Il coupait la masse des eaux avec
un frémissement sonore. Aucun détail n’était visible. En quatre minutes, il
avait franchi les quatre lieues qui le séparaient de la surface de l’Océan,
et, après avoir émergé comme un poisson volant, il retombait en faisant
jaillir les flots à une prodigieuse hauteur.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La mer de Sargasses 372
Cachalots et baleines
Pendant la nuit du 13 au 14 mars, le Nautilus reprit sa direction vers le
sud. Je pensais qu’à la hauteur du cap Horn, il mettrait le cap à l’ouest
afin de rallier les mers du Pacifique et d’achever son tour du monde. Il
n’en fit rien et continua de remonter vers les régions australes. Où
voulait−il donc aller ? Au pôle ? C’était insensé. Je commençai à croire
que les témérités du capitaine justifiaient suffisamment les appréhensions
de Ned Land.
Le Canadien, depuis quelque temps, ne me parlait plus de ses projets de
fuite. Il était devenu moins communicatif, presque silencieux. Je voyais
combien cet emprisonnement prolongé lui pesait. Je sentais ce qui
s’amassait de colère en lui. Lorsqu’il rencontrait le capitaine, ses yeux
s’allumaient d’un feu sombre, et je craignais toujours que sa violence
naturelle ne le portât à quelque extrémité.
Ce jour−là, 14 mars, Conseil et lui vinrent me trouver dans ma chambre.
Je leur demandai la raison de leur visite.
« Une simple question à vous poser, monsieur, me répondit le Canadien.
— Parlez, Ned.
— Combien d’hommes croyez−vous qu’il y ait à bord du Nautilus ?
— Je ne saurais le dire, mon ami.
— Il me semble, reprit Ned Land, que sa manoeuvre ne nécessite pas un
nombreux équipage.
— En effet, répondis−je, dans les conditions où il se trouve, une dizaine
Cachalots et baleines 373
d’hommes au plus doivent suffire à le manoeuvrer.
— Eh bien, dit le Canadien, pourquoi y en aurait−il davantage ?
— Pourquoi ? » répliquai−je.
Je regardai fixement Ned Land, dont les intentions étaient faciles à
deviner.
« Parce que, dis−je, si j’en crois mes pressentiments, si j’ai bien compris
l’existence du capitaine, le Nautilus n’est pas seulement un navire. Ce doit
être un lieu de refuge pour ceux qui, comme son commandant, ont rompu
toute relation avec la terre.
— Peut−être, dit Conseil, mais enfin le Nautilus ne peut contenir qu’un
certain nombre d’hommes, et monsieur ne pourrait−il évaluer ce
maximum ?
— Comment cela, Conseil ?
— Par le calcul. Étant donné la capacité du navire que monsieur connaît,
et, par conséquent, la quantité d’air qu’il renferme ; sachant d’autre part
ce que chaque homme dépense dans l’acte de la respiration, et comparant
ces résultats avec la nécessité où le Nautilus est de remonter toutes les
vingt−quatre heures... »
La phrase de Conseil n’en finissait pas, mais je vis bien où il voulait en
venir.
« Je te comprends, dis−je ; mais ce calcul−là, facile à établir d’ailleurs,
ne peut donner qu’un chiffre très incertain.
— N’importe, reprit Ned Land, en insistant.
— Voici le calcul, répondis−je. Chaque homme dépense en une heure
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 374
l’oxygène contenu dans cent litres d’air, soit en vingt−quatre heures
l’oxygène contenu dans deux mille quatre cents litres. Il faut donc
chercher combien de fois le Nautilus renferme deux mille quatre cents
litres d’air.
— Précisément, dit Conseil.
— Or, repris−je, la capacité du Nautilus étant de quinze cents tonneaux, et
celle du tonneau de mille litres, le Nautilus renferme quinze cent mille
litres d’air, qui, divisés par deux mille quatre cents... »
Je calculai rapidement au crayon :
« ... donnent au quotient six cent vingt−cinq. Ce qui revient à dire que l’air
contenu dans le Nautilus pourrait rigoureusement suffire à six cent
vingt−cinq hommes pendant vingt−quatre heures.
— Six cent vingt−cinq ! répéta Ned.
— Mais tenez pour certain, ajoutai−je, que, tant passagers que marins ou
officiers, nous ne formons pas la dixième partie de ce chiffre.
— C’est encore trop pour trois hommes ! murmura Conseil.
— Donc, mon pauvre Ned, je ne puis que vous conseiller la patience.
— Et même mieux que la patience, répondit Conseil, la résignation. »
Conseil avait employé le mot juste.
« Après tout, reprit−il, le capitaine Nemo ne peut pas aller toujours au
sud ! Il faudra bien qu’il s’arrête, ne fût−ce que devant la banquise, et
qu’il revienne vers des mers plus civilisées ! Alors, il sera temps de
reprendre les projets de Ned Land. »
Le Canadien secoua la tête, passa la main sur son front, ne répondit pas,
et se retira.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 375
« Que monsieur me permette de lui faire une observation, me dit alors
Conseil. Ce pauvre Ned pense à tout ce qu’il ne peut pas avoir. Tout lui
revient de sa vie passée. Tout lui semble regrettable de ce qui nous est
interdit. Ses anciens souvenirs l’oppressent et il a le coeur gros. Il faut le
comprendre. Qu’est−ce qu’il a à faire ici ? Rien. Il n’est pas un savant
comme monsieur, et ne saurait prendre le même goût que nous aux choses
admirables de la mer. Il risquerait tout pour pouvoir entrer dans une
taverne de son pays ! »
Il est certain que la monotonie du bord devait paraître insupportable au
Canadien, habitué à une vie libre et active. Les événements qui pouvaient
le passionner étaient rares. Cependant, ce jour−là, un incident vint lui
rappeler ses beaux jours de harponneur.
Vers onze heures du matin, étant à la surface de l’Océan, le Nautilus
tomba au milieu d’une troupe de baleines. Rencontre qui ne me surprit
pas, car je savais que ces animaux, chassés à outrance, se sont réfugiés
dans les bassins des hautes latitudes.
Le rôle joué par la baleine dans le monde marin, et son influence sur les
découvertes géographiques, ont été considérables. C’est elle, qui,
entraînant à sa suite, les Basques d’abord, puis les Asturiens, les Anglais
et les Hollandais, les enhardit contre les dangers de l’Océan et les
conduisit d’une extrémité de la terre à l’autre. Les baleines aiment à
fréquenter les mers australes et boréales. D’anciennes légendes prétendent
même que ces cétacés amenèrent les pêcheurs jusqu’à sept lieues
seulement du pôle nord. Si le fait est faux, il sera vrai un jour et c’est
probablement ainsi, en chassant la baleine dans les régions arctiques ou
antarctiques, que les hommes atteindront ce point inconnu du globe.
Nous étions assis sur la plate−forme par une mer tranquille. Mais le mois
d’octobre de ces latitudes nous donnait de belles journées d’automne. Ce
fut le Canadien — il ne pouvait s’y tromper — qui signala une baleine à
l’horizon dans l’est. En regardant attentivement, on voyait son dos
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 376
noirâtre s’élever et s’abaisser alternativement au−dessus des flots, à cinq
milles du Nautilus.
« Ah ! s’écria Ned Land, si j’étais à bord d’un baleinier, voilà une
rencontre qui me ferait plaisir ! C’est un animal de grande taille ! Voyez
avec quelle puissance ses évents rejettent des colonnes d’air et de vapeur !
Mille diables ! pourquoi faut−il que je sois enchaîné sur ce morceau de
tôle !
— Quoi ! Ned, répondis−je, vous n’êtes pas encore revenu de vos vieilles
idées de pêche ?
— Est−ce qu’un pêcheur de baleines, monsieur, peut oublier son ancien
métier ? Est−ce qu’on se lasse jamais des émotions d’une pareille
chasse ?
— Vous n’avez jamais pêché dans ces mers, Ned ?
— Jamais, monsieur. Dans les mers boréales seulement, et autant dans le
détroit de Bering que dans celui de Davis.
— Alors la baleine australe vous est encore inconnue. C’est la baleine
franche que vous avez chassée jusqu’ici, et elle ne se hasarderait pas à
passer les eaux chaudes de l’Équateur.
— Ah ! monsieur le professeur, que me dites−vous là ? répliqua le
Canadien d’un ton passablement incrédule.
— Je dis ce qui est.
— Par exemple ! Moi qui vous parle, en soixante−cinq, voilà deux ans et
demi, j’ai amariné près du Groenland une baleine qui portait encore dans
son flanc le harpon poinçonné d’un baleinier de Bering. Or, je vous
demande, comment après avoir été frappé à l’ouest de l’Amérique,
l’animal serait venu se faire tuer à l’est, s’il n’avait, après avoir doublé,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 377
soit le cap Horn, soit le cap de Bonne Espérance, franchi l’Équateur ?
— Je pense comme l’ami Ned, dit Conseil, et j’attends ce que répondra
monsieur.
— Monsieur vous répondra, mes amis, que les baleines sont localisées,
suivant leurs espèces, dans certaines mers qu’elles ne quittent pas. Et si
l’un de ces animaux est venu du détroit de Béring dans celui de Davis,
c’est tout simplement parce qu’il existe un passage d’une mer à l’autre,
soit sur les côtes de l’Amérique, soit sur celles de l’Asie.
— Faut−il vous croire ? demanda le Canadien, en fermant un oeil.
— Il faut croire monsieur, répondit Conseil.
— Dès lors, reprit le Canadien, puisque je n’ai jamais pêché dans ces
parages, je ne connais point les baleines qui les fréquentent ?
— Je vous l’ai dit, Ned.
— Raison de plus pour faire leur connaissance, répliqua Conseil.
— Voyez ! voyez ! s’écria le Canadien la voix émue. Elle s’approche ! Elle
vient sur nous ! Elle me nargue ! Elle sait que je ne peux rien contre elle !
»
Ned frappait du pied. Sa main frémissait en brandissant un harpon
imaginaire.
« Ces cétacés, demanda−t−il, sont−ils aussi gros que ceux des mers
boréales ?
— A peu près, Ned.
— C’est que j’ai vu de grosses baleines, monsieur, des baleines qui
mesuraient jusqu’à cent pieds de longueur !
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 378
Je me suis même laissé dire que le Hullamock et l’Umgallick des îles
Aléoutiennes dépassaient quelquefois cent cinquante pieds.
— Ceci me paraît exagéré, répondis−je. Ces animaux ne sont que des
baleinoptères, pourvus de nageoires dorsales, et de même que les
cachalots, ils sont généralement plus petits que la baleine franche.
— Ah ! s’écria le Canadien, dont les regards ne quittaient pas l’Océan,
elle se rapproche, elle vient dans les eaux du Nautilus ! »
Puis, reprenant sa conversation :
« Vous parlez, dit−il, du cachalot comme d’une petite bête ! On cite
cependant des cachalots gigantesques. Ce sont des cétacés intelligents.
Quelques−uns, dit−on, se couvrent d’algues et de fucus. On les prend pour
des îlots. On campe dessus, on s’y installe, on fait du feu...
— On y bâtit des maisons, dit Conseil.
— Oui, farceur, répondit Ned Land. Puis, un beau jour l’animal plonge et
entraîne tous ses habitants au fond de l’abîme.
— Comme dans les voyages de Simbad le marin, répliquai−je en riant.
— Ah ! maître Land, il paraît que vous aimez les histoires
extraordinaires ! Quels cachalots que les vôtres ! J’espère que vous n’y
croyez pas !
— Monsieur le naturaliste, répondit sérieusement le Canadien, il faut tout
croire de la part des baleines !
— Comme elle marche, celle−ci ! Comme elle se dérobe !
— On prétend que ces animaux−là peuvent faire le tour du monde en
quinze jours.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 379
— Je ne dis pas non.
— Mais, ce que vous ne savez sans doute pas, monsieur Aronnax, c’est
que, au commencement du monde, les baleines filaient plus rapidement
encore.
— Ah ! vraiment, Ned ! Et pourquoi cela ?
— Parce que alors, elles avaient la queue en travers, comme les poissons,
c’est−à−dire que cette queue, comprimée verticalement, frappait l’eau de
gauche à droite et de droite à gauche. Mais le Créateur, s’apercevant
qu’elles marchaient trop vite, leur tordit la queue, et depuis ce temps−là,
elles battent les flots de haut en bas au détriment de leur rapidité.
— Bon, Ned, dis−je, en reprenant une expression du Canadien, faut−il
vous croire ?
— Pas trop, répondit Ned Land, et pas plus que si je vous disais qu’il
existe des baleines longues de trois cents pieds et pesant cent mille livres.
— C’est beaucoup, en effet, dis−je. Cependant, il faut avouer que certains
cétacés acquièrent un développement considérable, puisque, dit−on, ils
fournissent jusqu’à cent vingt tonnes d’huile.
— Pour ça, je l’ai vu, dit le Canadien.
— Je le crois volontiers, Ned, comme je crois que certaines baleines
égalent en grosseur cent éléphants. Jugez des effets produits par une telle
masse lancée à toute vitesse !
— Est−il vrai, demanda Conseil, qu’elles peuvent couler des navires ?
— Des navires, je ne le crois pas, répondis−je. On raconte, cependant,
qu’en 1820, précisément dans ces mers du sud, une baleine se précipita
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 380
sur l’Essex et le fit reculer avec une vitesse de quatre mètres par seconde.
Des lames pénétrèrent par l’arrière, et l’Essex sombra presque aussitôt. »
Ned me regarda d’un air narquois.
« Pour mon compte, dit−il, j’ai reçu un coup de queue de baleine — dans
mon canot, cela va sans dire. Mes compagnons et moi, nous avons été
lancés à une hauteur de six mètres. Mais auprès de la baleine de monsieur
le professeur, la mienne n’était qu’un baleineau.
— Est−ce que ces animaux−là vivent longtemps ? demanda Conseil.
— Mille ans, répondit le Canadien sans hésiter.
— Et comment le savez−vous, Ned ?
— Parce qu’on le dit.
— Et pourquoi le dit−on ?
— Parce qu’on le sait.
— Non, Ned, on ne le sait pas, mais on le suppose, et voici le raisonnement
sur lequel on s’appuie. Il y a quatre cents ans, lorsque les pêcheurs
chassèrent pour la première fois les baleines, ces animaux avaient une
taille supérieure à celle qu’ils acquièrent aujourd’hui. On suppose donc,
assez logiquement, que l’infériorité des baleines actuelles vient de ce
qu’elles n’ont pas eu le temps d’atteindre leur complet développement.
C’est ce qui a fait dire à Buffon que ces cétacés pouvaient et devaient
même vivre mille ans. Vous entendez ? »
Ned Land n’entendait pas. Il n’écoutait plus. La baleine s’approchait
toujours. Il la dévorait des yeux.
« Ah ! s’écria−t−il, ce n’est plus une baleine, c’est dix, c’est vingt, c’est un
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 381
troupeau tout entier ! Et ne pouvoir rien faire ! Etre là pieds et poings
liés !
— Mais, ami Ned, dit Conseil, pourquoi ne pas demander au capitaine
Nemo la permission de chasser ? ... »
Conseil n’avait pas achevé sa phrase, que Ned Land s’était affalé par le
panneau et courait à la recherche du capitaine. Quelques instants après,
tous deux reparaissaient sur la plate−forme.
Le capitaine Nemo observa le troupeau de cétacés qui se jouait sur les
eaux à un mille du Nautilus.
« Ce sont des baleines australes, dit−il. Il y a là la fortune d’une flotte de
baleiniers.
— Eh ! bien, monsieur, demanda le Canadien, ne pourrais−je leur donner
la chasse, ne fût−ce que pour ne pas oublier mon ancien métier de
harponneur ?
— A quoi bon, répondit le capitaine Nemo, chasser uniquement pour
détruire ! Nous n’avons que faire d’huile de baleine à bord.
— Cependant, monsieur, reprit le Canadien, dans la mer Rouge, vous nous
avez autorisés à poursuivre un dugong !
— Il s’agissait alors de procurer de la viande fraîche à mon équipage. Ici,
ce serait tuer pour tuer. Je sais bien que c’est un privilège réservé à
l’homme, mais je n’admets pas ces passe−temps meurtriers. En détruisant
la baleine australe comme la baleine franche, êtres inoffensifs et bons, vos
pareils, maître Land, commettent une action blâmable. C’est ainsi qu’ils
ont déjà dépeuplé toute la baie de Baffin, et qu’ils anéantiront une classe
d’animaux utiles. Laissez donc tranquilles ces malheureux cétacés. Ils ont
bien assez de leurs ennemis naturels, les cachalots, les espadons et les
scies, sans que vous vous en mêliez. »
Je laisse à imaginer la figure que faisait le Canadien pendant ce cours de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 382
morale. Donner de semblables raisons à un chasseur, c’était perdre ses
paroles. Ned Land regardait le capitaine Nemo et ne comprenait
évidemment pas ce qu’il voulait lui dire. Cependant, le capitaine avait
raison. L’acharnement barbare et inconsidéré des pêcheurs fera
disparaître un jour la dernière baleine de l’Océan.
Ned Land siffla entre les dents son Yankee doodle, fourra ses mains dans
ses poches et nous tourna le dos.
Cependant le capitaine Nemo observait le troupeau de cétacés, et
s’adressant à moi :
« J’avais raison de prétendre, que sans compter l’homme, les baleines ont
assez d’autres ennemis naturels. Celles−ci vont avoir affaire à forte partie
avant peu. Apercevez−vous, monsieur Aronnax, à huit milles sous le vent
ces points noirâtres qui sont en mouvement ?
— Oui, capitaine, répondis−je.
— Ce sont des cachalots, animaux terribles que j’ai quelquefois rencontrés
par troupes de deux ou trois cents ! Quant à ceux−là, bêtes cruelles et
malfaisantes, on a raison de les exterminer. »
Le Canadien se retourna vivement à ces derniers mots.
« Eh bien, capitaine, dis−je, il est temps encore, dans l’intérêt même des
baleines...
— Inutile de s’exposer, monsieur le professeur. Le Nautilus suffira à
disperser ces cachalots. Il est armé d’un éperon d’acier qui vaut bien le
harpon de maître Land, j’imagine. »
Le Canadien ne se gêna pas pour hausser les épaules. Attaquer des
cétacés à coups d’éperon ! Qui avait jamais entendu parler de cela ?
« Attendez, monsieur Aronnax, dit le capitaine Nemo. Nous vous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 383
montrerons une chasse que vous ne connaissez pas encore. Pas de pitié
pour ces féroces cétacés. Ils ne sont que bouche et dents ! »
Bouche et dents ! On ne pouvait mieux peindre le cachalot macrocéphale,
dont la taille dépasse quelque fois vingt−cinq mètres. La tête énorme de ce
cétacé occupe environ le tiers de son corps. Mieux armé que la baleine,
dont la mâchoire supérieure est seulement garnie de fanons, il est muni de
vingt−cinq grosses dents, hautes de vingt centimètres, cylindriques et
coniques à leur sommet, et qui pèsent deux livres chacune. C’est à la
partie supérieure de cette énorme tête et dans de grandes cavités séparées
par des cartilages, que se trouvent trois à quatre cents kilogrammes de
cette huile précieuse, dite « blanc de baleine ». Le cachalot est un animal
disgracieux, plutôt têtard que poisson, suivant la remarque de Frédol. Il
est mal construit, étant pour ainsi dire « manqué » dans toute la partie
gauche de sa charpente, et n’y voyant guère que de l’oeil droit.
Cependant, le monstrueux troupeau s’approchait toujours. Il avait aperçu
les baleines et se préparait à les attaquer. On pouvait préjuger, d’avance,
la victoire des cachalots, non seulement parce qu’ils sont mieux bâtis pour
l’attaque que leurs inoffensifs adversaires. mais aussi parce qu’ils peuvent
rester plus longtemps sous les flots, sans venir respirer à leur surface.
Il n’était que temps d’aller au secours des baleines. Le Nautilus se mit
entre deux eaux. Conseil, Ned et moi, nous prîmes place devant les vitres
du salon. Le capitaine Nemo se rendit près du timonier pour manoeuvrer
son appareil comme un engin de destruction. Bientôt, je sentis les
battements de l’hélice se précipiter et notre vitesse s’accroître.
Le combat était déjà commencé entre les cachalots et les baleines, lorsque
le Nautilus arriva. Il manoeuvra de manière à couper la troupe des
macrocéphales. Ceux−ci, tout d’abord, se montrèrent peu émus à la vue
du nouveau monstre qui se mêlait à la bataille. Mais bientôt ils durent se
garer de ses coups.
Quelle lutte ! Ned Land lui−même, bientôt enthousiasmé, finit par battre
des mains. Le Nautilus n’était plus qu’un harpon formidable, brandi par la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 384
main de son capitaine. Il se lançait contre ces masses charnues et les
traversait de part en part, laissant après son passage deux grouillantes
moitiés d’animal. Les formidables coups de queue qui frappaient ses
flancs, il ne les sentait pas. Les chocs qu’il produisait, pas davantage. Un
cachalot exterminé, il courait à un autre, virait sur place pour ne pas
manquer sa proie, allant de l’avant, de l’arrière, docile à son gouvernail,
plongeant quand le cétacé s’enfonçait dans les couches profondes,
remontant avec lui lorsqu’il revenait à la surface, le frappant de plein ou
d’écharpe, le coupant ou le déchirant, et dans toutes les directions et sous
toutes les allures, le perçant de son terrible éperon.
Quel carnage ! Quel bruit à la surface des flots ! Quels sifflements aigus et
quels ronflements particuliers à ces animaux épouvantés ! Au milieu de ces
couches ordinairement si paisibles, leur queue créait de véritables houles.
Pendant une heure se prolongea cet homérique massacre, auquel les
macrocéphales ne pouvaient se soustraire. Plusieurs fois, dix ou douze
réunis essayèrent d’écraser le Nautilus sous leur masse. On voyait, à la
vitre, leur gueule énorme pavée de dents, leur oeil formidable. Ned Land,
qui ne se possédait plus, les menaçait et les injuriait. On sentait qu’ils se
cramponnaient à notre appareil, comme des chiens qui coiffent un ragot
sous les taillis. Mais le Nautilus, forçant son hélice, les emportait, les
entraînait, ou les ramenait vers le niveau supérieur des eaux, sans se
soucier ni de leur poids énorme, ni de leurs puissantes étreintes.
Enfin la masse des cachalots s’éclaircit. Les flots redevinrent tranquilles.
Je sentis que nous remontions à la surface de l’Océan. Le panneau fut
ouvert, et nous nous précipitâmes sur la plate−forme.
La mer était couverte de cadavres mutilés. Une explosion formidable n’eût
pas divisé, déchiré, déchiqueté avec plus de violence ces masses charnues.
Nous flottions au milieu de corps gigantesques, bleuâtres sur le dos,
blanchâtres sous le ventre, et tout bossués d’énormes protubérances.
Quelques cachalots épouvantés fuyaient à l’horizon. Les flots étaient teints
en rouge sur un espace de plusieurs milles ; et le Nautilus flottait au milieu
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 385
d’une mer de sang.
Le capitaine Nemo nous rejoignit.
« Eh bien, maître Land ? dit−il.
— Eh bien, monsieur, répondit le Canadien, chez lequel l’enthousiasme
s’était calmé, c’est un spectacle terrible, en effet. Mais je ne suis pas un
boucher, je suis un chasseur, et ceci n’est qu’une boucherie.
— C’est un massacre d’animaux malfaisants, répondit le capitaine, et le
Nautilus n’est pas un couteau de boucher.
— J’aime mieux mon harpon, répliqua le Canadien.
— Chacun son arme », répondit le capitaine, en regardant fixement Ned
Land.
Je craignais que celui−ci ne se laissât emporter à quelque violence qui
aurait eu des conséquences déplorables. Mais sa colère fut détournée par
la vue d’une baleine que le Nautilus accostait en ce moment.
L’animal n’avait pu échapper à la dent des cachalots. Je reconnus la
baleine australe, à tête déprimée, qui est entièrement noire.
Anatomiquement, elle se distingue de la baleine blanche et du
Nord−Caper par la soudure des sept vertèbres cervicales, et elle compte
deux côtes de plus que ses congénères. Le malheureux cétacé, couché sur
le flanc, le ventre troué de morsures, était mort. Au bout de sa nageoire
mutilée pendait encore un petit baleineau qu’il n’avait pu sauver du
massacre. Sa bouche ouverte laissait couler l’eau qui murmurait comme
un ressac à travers ses fanons.
Le capitaine Nemo conduisit le Nautilus près du cadavre de l’animal.
Deux de ses hommes montèrent sur le flanc de la baleine, et je vis, non
sans étonnement, qu’ils retiraient de ses mamelles tout le lait qu’elles
contenaient, c’est−à−dire la valeur de deux à trois tonneaux. Le capitaine
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 386
m’offrit une tasse de ce lait encore chaud. Je ne pus m’empêcher de lui
marquer ma répugnance pour ce breuvage. Il m’assura que ce lait était
excellent, et qu’il ne se distinguait en aucune façon du lait de vache.
Je le goûtai et je fus de son avis. C’était donc pour nous neréserve utile,
car, ce lait, sous la forme de beurre salé ou de fromage, devait apporter
une agréable variété à notre ordinaire.
De ce jour−là, je remarquai avec inquiétude que les dispositions de Ned
Land envers le capitaine Nemo devenaient de plus en plus mauvaises, et je
résolus de surveiller de près les faits et gestes du Canadien.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Cachalots et baleines 387
La banquise
Le Nautilus avait repris son imperturbable direction vers le sud. Il suivait
le cinquantième méridien avec une vitesse considérable. Voulait−il donc
atteindre le pôle ? Je ne le pensais pas, car jusqu’ici toutes les tentatives
pour s’élever jusqu’à ce point du globe avaient échoué. La saison,
d’ailleurs, était déjà fort avancée, puisque le 13 mars des terres
antarctiques correspond au 13 septembre des régions boréales, qui
commence la période équinoxiale.
Le 14 mars, j’aperçus des glaces flottantes par 55° de latitude, simples
débris blafards de vingt à vingt−cinq pieds, formant des écueils sur
lesquels la mer déferlait. Le Nautilus se maintenait à la surface de
l’Océan. Ned Land, ayant déjà pêché dans les mers arctiques, était
familiarisé avec ce spectacle des icebergs. Conseil et moi, nous
l’admirions pour la première fois.
Dans l’atmosphère, vers l’horizon du sud, s’étendait une bande blanche
d’un éblouissant aspect. Les baleiniers anglais lui ont donné le nom de «
ice−blinck ». Quelque épais que soient les nuages, ils ne peuvent
l’obscurcir. Elle annonce la présence d’un pack ou banc de glace.
En effet, bientôt apparurent des blocs plus considérables dont l’éclat se
modifiait suivant les caprices de la brume. Quelques−unes de ces masses
montraient des veines vertes, comme si le sulfate de cuivre en eût tracé les
lignes ondulées. D’autres, semblables à d’énormes améthystes, se
laissaient pénétrer par la lumière. Celles−ci réverbéraient les rayons du
jour sur les mille facettes de leurs cristaux. Celles−là, nuancées des vifs
reflets du calcaire, auraient suffi à la construction de toute une ville de
marbre.
Plus nous descendions au sud, plus ces îles flottantes gagnaient en nombre
La banquise 388
et en importance. Les oiseaux polaires y nichaient par milliers. C’étaient
des pétrels, des damiers, des puffins, qui nous assourdissaient de leurs
cris. Quelques−uns, prenant le Nautilus pour le cadavre d’une baleine,
venaient s’y reposer et piquaient de coups de bec sa tôle sonore.
Pendant cette navigation au milieu des glaces, le capitaine Nemo se tint
souvent sur la plate−forme. Il observait avec attention ces parages
abandonnés. Je voyais son calme regard s’animer parfois. Se disait−il que
dans ces mers polaires interdites à l’homme, il était là chez lui, maître de
ces infranchissables espaces ? Peut−être. Mais il ne parlait pas. Il restait
immobile, ne revenant à lui que lorsque ses instincts de manoeuvrier
reprenaient le dessus. Dirigeant alors son Nautilus avec une adresse
consommée, il évitait habilement le choc de ces masses dont
quelques−unes mesuraient une longueur de plusieurs milles sur une
hauteur qui variait de soixante−dix à quatre−vingts mètres. Souvent
l’horizon paraissait entièrement fermé. A la hauteur du soixantième degré
de latitude, toute passe avait disparu. Mais le capitaine Nemo, cherchant
avec soin, trouvait bientôt quelque étroite ouverture par laquelle il se
glissait audacieusement, sachant bien, cependant, qu’elle se refermerait
derrière lui.
Ce fut ainsi que le Nautilus, guidé par cette main habile, dépassa toutes
ces glaces, classées, suivant leur forme ou leur grandeur, avec une
précision qui enchantait Conseil : icebergs ou montagnes, ice−fields ou
champs unis et sans limites, drift−ice ou glaces flottantes, packs ou
champs brisés, nommés palchs quand ils sont circulaires, et streams
lorsqu’ils sont faits de morceaux allongés.
La température était assez basse. Le thermomètre, exposé à l’air extérieur,
marquait deux à trois degrés au−dessous de zéro. Mais nous étions
chaudement habillés de fourrures, dont les phoques ou les ours marins
avaient fait les frais. L’intérieur du Nautilus, régulièrement chauffé par ses
appareils électriques, défiait les froids les plus intenses. D’ailleurs, il lui
eût suffi de s’enfoncer à quelques mètres au−dessous des flots pour y
trouver une température supportable.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 389
Deux mois plus tôt, nous aurions joui sous cette latitude d’un jour
perpétuel ; mais déjà la nuit se faisait pendant trois ou quatre heures, et
plus tard, elle devait jeter six mois d’ombre sur ces régions
circumpolaires.
Le 15 mars, la latitude des îles New−Shetland et des Orkney du Sud fut
dépassée. Le capitaine m’apprit qu’autrefois de nombreuses tribus de
phoques habitaient ces terres ; mais les baleiniers anglais et américains,
dans leur rage de destruction, massacrant les adultes et les femelles
pleines, là où existait l’animation de la vie, avaient laissé après eux le
silence de la mort.
Le 16 mars, vers huit heures du matin, le Nautilus, suivant le
cinquante−cinquième méridien, coupa le cercle polaire antarctique. Les
glaces nous entouraient de toutes parts et fermaient l’horizon. Cependant,
le capitaine Nemo marchait de passe en passe et s’élevait toujours.
« Mais où va−t−il ? demandai−je.
— Devant lui, répondait Conseil. Après tout, lorsqu’il ne pourra pas aller
plus loin, il s’arrêtera.
— Je n’en jurerais pas ! » répondis−je.
Et, pour être franc, j’avouerai que cette excursion aventureuse ne me
déplaisait point. A quel degré m’émerveillaient les beautés de ces régions
nouvelles, je ne saurais l’exprimer. Les glaces prenaient des attitudes
superbes. Ici, leur ensemble formait une ville orientale, avec ses minarets
et ses mosquées innombrables. Là, une cité écroulée et comme jetée à terre
par une convulsion du sol. Aspects incessamment variés par les obliques
rayons du soleil, ou perdus dans les brumes grises au milieu des ouragans
de neige. Puis, de toutes parts des détonations, des éboulements, de
grandes culbutes d’icebergs, qui changeaient le décor comme le paysage
d’un diorama.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 390
Lorsque le Nautilus était immergé au moment où se rompaient ces
équilibres, le bruit se propageait sous les eaux avec une effrayante
intensité, et la chute de ces masses créait de redoutables remous jusque
dans les couches profondes de l’Océan. Le Nautilus roulait et tanguait
alors comme un navire abandonne à la furie des éléments.
Souvent, ne voyant plus aucune issue, je pensais que nous étions
définitivement prisonniers ; mais, l’instinct le guidant, sur le plus léger
indice le capitaine Nemo découvrait des passes nouvelles. Il ne se trompait
jamais en observant les minces filets d’eau bleuâtre qui sillonnaient les
ice−fields. Aussi ne mettais−je pas en doute qu’il n’eût aventuré déjà le
Nautilus au milieu des mers antarctiques.
Cependant, dans la journée du 16 mars, les champs de glace nous
barrèrent absolument la route. Ce n’était pas encore la banquise, mais de
vastes ice−fields cimentés par le froid. Cet obstacle ne pouvait arrêter le
capitaine Nemo, et il se lança contre l’ice−field avec une effroyable
violence. Le Nautilus entrait comme un coin dans cette masse friable, et la
divisait avec des craquements terribles. C’était l’antique bélier poussé par
une puissance infinie. Les débris de glace, haut projetés, retombaient en
grêle autour de nous. Par sa seule force d’impulsion, notre appareil se
creusait un chenal. Quelquefois, emporté par son élan, il montait sur le
champ de glace et l’écrasait de son poids, ou par instants, enfourné sous
l’ice−field, il le divisait par un simple mouvement de tangage qui
produisait de larges déchirures.
Pendant ces journées, de violents grains nous assaillirent. Par certaines
brumes épaisses, on ne se fût pas vu d’une extrémité de la plate−forme à
l’autre. Le vent sautait brusquement à tous les points du compas. La neige
s’accumulait en couches si dures qu’il fallait la briser à coups de pic. Rien
qu’à la température de cinq degrés au−dessous de zéro, toutes les parties
extérieures du Nautilus se recouvraient de glaces. Un gréement n’aurait
pu se manoeuvrer, car tous les garants eussent été engagés dans la gorge
des poulies. Un bâtiment sans voiles et mû par un moteur électrique qui se
passait de charbon, pouvait seul affronter d’aussi hautes latitudes.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 391
Dans ces conditions, le baromètre se tint généralement très bas. Il tomba
même à 73°5’. Les indications de la boussole n’offraient plus aucune
garantie. Ses aiguilles affolées marquaient des directions contradictoires,
en s’approchant du pôle magnétique méridional qui ne se confond pas
avec le sud du monde. En effet, suivant Hansten, ce pôle est situé à peu
près par 70° de latitude et 130° de longitude, et d’après les observations
de Duperrey, par 135° de longitude et 70°30’de latitude. Il fallait faire
alors des observations nombreuses sur les compas transportés à
différentes parties du navire et prendre une moyenne. Mais souvent, on
s’en rapportait à l’estime pour relever la route parcourue, méthode peu
satisfaisante au milieu de ces passes sinueuses dont les points de repère
changent incessamment.
Enfin, le 18 mars, après vingt assauts inutiles, le Nautilus se vit
définitivement enrayé. Ce n’étaient plus ni les streams, ni les palks, ni les
ice−fields, mais une interminable et immobile barrière formée de
montagnes soudées entre elles.
« La banquise ! » me dit le Canadien.
Je compris que pour Ned Land comme pour tous les navigateurs qui nous
avaient précédé, c’était l’infranchissable obstacle. Le soleil ayant un
instant paru vers midi, le capitaine Nemo obtint une observation assez
exacte qui donnait notre situation par 51°30’de longitude et 67°39’de
latitude méridionale. C’était déjà un point avancé des régions
antarctiques.
De mer, de surface liquide, il n’y avait plus apparence devant nos yeux.
Sous l’éperon du Nautilus s’étendait une vaste plaine tourmentée,
enchevêtrée de blocs confus, avec tout ce pêle−mêle capricieux qui
caractérise la surface d’un fleuve quelque temps avant la débâcle des
glaces, mais sur des proportions gigantesques. Çà et là, des pics aigus, des
aiguilles déliées s’élevant à une hauteur de deux cents pieds ; plus loin,
une suite de falaises taillées à pic et revêtues de teintes grisâtres, vastes
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 392
miroirs qui reflétaient quelques rayons de soleil à demi noyés dans les
brumes. Puis, sur cette nature désolée, un silence farouche, à peine rompu
par le battement d’ailes des pétrels ou des puffins. Tout était gelé alors,
même le bruit.
Le Nautilus dut donc s’arrêter dans son aventureuse course au milieu des
champs de glace.
« Monsieur, me dit ce jour−là Ned Land, si votre capitaine va plus loin !
— Eh bien ?
— Ce sera un maître homme.
— Pourquoi, Ned ?
— Parce que personne ne peut franchir la banquise. Il est puissant, votre
capitaine ; mais, mille diables ! il n’est pas plus puissant que la nature, et
là où elle a mis des bornes, il faut que l’on s’arrête bon gré mal gré.
— En effet, Ned Land, et cependant j’aurais voulu savoir ce qu’il y a
derrière cette banquise ! Un mur, voilà ce qui m’irrite le plus !
— Monsieur a raison, dit Conseil. Les murs n’ont été inventés que pour
agacer les savants. Il ne devrait y avoir de murs nulle part.
— Bon ! fit le Canadien. Derrière cette banquise, on sait bien ce qui se
trouve.
— Quoi donc ? demandai−je.
— De la glace, et toujours de la glace !
— Vous êtes certain de ce fait, Ned, répliquai−je, mais moi je ne le suis
pas. Voilà pourquoi je voudrais aller voir.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 393
— Eh bien, monsieur le professeur, répondit le Canadien, renoncez à cette
idée. Vous êtes arrivé à la banquise, ce qui est déjà suffisant, et vous n’irez
pas plus loin, ni votre capitaine Nemo, ni son Nautilus. Et qu’il le veuille
ou non, nous reviendrons vers le nord, c’est−à−dire au pays des honnêtes
gens. »
Je dois convenir que Ned Land avait raison, et tant que les navires ne
seront pas faits pour naviguer sur les champs de glace, ils devront
s’arrêter devant la banquise.
En effet, malgré ses efforts, malgré les moyens puissants employés pour
disjoindre les glaces, le Nautilus fut réduit à l’immobilité. Ordinairement,
qui ne peut aller plus loin en est quitte pour revenir sur ses pas. Mais ici,
revenir était aussi impossible qu’avancer, car les passes s’étaient
refermées derrière nous, et pour peu que notre appareil demeurât
stationnaire, il ne tarderait pas à être bloqué. Ce fut même ce qui arriva
vers deux heures du soir, et la jeune glace se forma sur ses flancs avec une
étonnante rapidité. Je dus avouer que la conduite du capitaine Nemo était
plus qu’imprudente.
J’étais en ce moment sur la plate−forme. Le capitaine qui observait la
situation depuis quelques instants, me dit :
« Eh bien, monsieur le professeur, qu’en pensez−vous ?
— Je pense que nous sommes pris, capitaine.
— Pris ! Et comment l’entendez−vous ?
— J’entends que nous ne pouvons aller ni en avant ni en arrière, ni
d’aucun côté. C’est, je crois, ce qui s’appelle « pris », du moins sur les
continents habités.
— Ainsi, monsieur Aronnax, vous pensez que le Nautilus ne pourra pas se
dégager ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 394
— Difficilement, capitaine, car la saison est déjà trop avancée pour que
vous comptiez sur une débâcle des glaces.
— Ah ! monsieur le professeur, répondit le capitaine Nemo d’un ton
ironique, vous serez toujours le même ! Vous ne voyez qu’empêchements et
obstacles ! Moi, je vous affirme que non seulement le Nautilus se
dégagera, mais qu’il ira plus loin encore !
— Plus loin au sud ? demandai−je en regardant le capitaine.
— Oui, monsieur, il ira au pôle.
— Au pôle ! m’écriai−je, ne pouvant retenir un mouvement d’incrédulité.
— Oui, répondit froidement le capitaine, au pôle antarctique, à ce point
inconnu où se croisent tous les méridiens du globe. Vous savez si je fais du
Nautilus ce que je veux. »
Oui ! je le savais. Je savais cet homme audacieux jusqu’à la témérité !
Mais vaincre ces obstacles qui hérissent le pôle sud, plus inaccessible que
ce pôle nord non encore atteint par les plus hardis navigateurs, n’était−ce
pas une entreprise absolument insensée, et que, seul, l’esprit d’un fou
pouvait concevoir !
Il me vint alors à l’idée de demander au capitaine Nemo s’il avait déjà
découvert ce pôle que n’avait jamais foulé le pied d’une créature humaine.
« Non, monsieur, me répondit−il, et nous le découvrirons ensemble. Là où
d’autres ont échoué, je n’échouerai pas. Jamais je n’ai promené mon
Nautilus aussi loin sur les mers australes ; mais, je vous le répète, il ira
plus loin encore.
— Je veux vous croire, capitaine, repris−je d’un ton un peu ironique. Je
vous crois ! Allons en avant ! Il n’y a pas d’obstacles pour nous ! Brisons
cette banquise ! Faisons−la sauter, et si elle résiste, donnons des ailes au
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 395
Nautilus, afin qu’il puisse passer par−dessus !
— Par−dessus ? monsieur le professeur, répondit tranquillement le
capitaine Nemo. Non point par−dessus, mais par−dessous.
— Par−dessous ! » m’écriai−je.
Une subite révélation des projets du capitaine venait d’illuminer mon
esprit. J’avais compris. Les merveilleuses qualités du Nautilus allaient le
servir encore dans cette surhumaine entreprise !
« Je vois que nous commençons à nous entendre, monsieur le professeur,
me dit le capitaine, souriant à demi. Vous entrevoyez déjà la possibilité —
moi, je dirai le succès — de cette tentative. Ce qui est impraticable avec un
navire ordinaire devient facile au Nautilus. Si un continent émerge au
pôle, il s’arrêtera devant ce continent. Mais si au contraire c’est la mer
libre qui le baigne, il ira au pôle même !
— En effet, dis−je, entraîné par le raisonnement du capitaine, si la surface
de la mer est solidifiée par les glaces, ses couches inférieures sont libres,
par cette raison providentielle qui a placé à un degré supérieur à celui de
la congélation le maximum de densité de l’eau de mer. Et, si je ne me
trompe, la partie immergée de cette banquise est à la partie émergeante
comme quatre est à un ?
— A peu près, monsieur le professeur. Pour un pied que les icebergs ont
au−dessus de la mer, ils en ont trois au−dessous. Or, puisque ces
montagnes de glaces ne dépassent pas une hauteur de cent mètres, elles ne
s’enfoncent que de trois cents. Or, qu’est−ce que trois cents mètres pour le
Nautilus ?
— Rien, monsieur.
— Il pourra même aller chercher à une profondeur plus grande cette
température uniforme des eaux marines, et là nous braverons impunément
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 396
les trente ou quarante degrés de froid de la surface.
— Juste, monsieur, très juste, répondis−je en m’animant.
— La seule difficulté, reprit le capitaine Nemo, sera de rester plusieurs
jours immergés sans renouveler notre provision d’air.
— N’est−ce que cela ? répliquai−je. Le Nautilus a de vastes réservoirs,
nous les remplirons, et ils nous fourniront tout l’oxygène dont nous aurons
besoin.
— Bien imaginé, monsieur Aronnax, répondit en souriant le capitaine.
Mais ne voulant pas que vous puissiez m’accuser de témérité, je vous
soumets d’avance toutes mes objections.
— En avez−vous encore à faire ?
— Une seule. Il est possible, si la mer existe au pôle sud, que cette mer soit
entièrement prise, et, par conséquent, que nous ne puissions revenir à sa
surface !
— Bon, monsieur, oubliez−vous que le Nautilus est armé d’un redoutable
éperon, et ne pourrons−nous le lancer diagonalement contre ces champs
de glace qui s’ouvriront au choc ?
— Eh ! monsieur le professeur, vous avez des idées aujourd’hui !
— D’ailleurs, capitaine, ajoutai−je en m’enthousiasmant de plus belle,
pourquoi ne rencontrerait−on pas la mer libre au pôle sud comme au pôle
nord ? Les pôles du froid et les pôles de la terre ne se confondent ni dans
l’hémisphère austral ni dans l’hémisphère boréal, et jusqu’à preuve
contraire, on doit supposer ou un continent ou un océan dégagé de glaces
à ces deux points du globe.
— Je le crois aussi, monsieur Aronnax, répondit le capitaine Nemo. Je
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 397
vous ferai seulement observer qu’après avoir émis tant d’objections contre
mon projet, maintenant vous m’écrasez d’arguments en sa faveur. »
Le capitaine Nemo disait vrai. J’en étais arrivé à le vaincre en audace !
C’était moi qui l’entraînais au pôle ! Je le devançais, je le distançais...
Mais non ! pauvre fou. Le capitaine Nemo savait mieux que toi le pour et
le contre de la question, et il s’amusait à te voir emporté dans les rêveries
de l’impossible !
Cependant, il n’avait pas perdu un instant. A un signal le second parut.
Ces deux hommes s’entretinrent rapidement dans leur incompréhensible
langage, et soit que le second eût été antérieurement prévenu, soit qu’il
trouvât le projet praticable, il ne laissa voir aucune surprise.
Mais si impassible qu’il fût il ne montra pas une plus complète
impassibilité que Conseil, lorsque j’annonçai à ce digne garçon notre
intention de pousser jusqu’au pôle sud. Un « comme il plaira à monsieur »
accueillit ma communication, et je dus m’en contenter. Quant à Ned Land,
si jamais épaules se levèrent haut, ce furent celles du Canadien.
« Voyez−vous, monsieur, me dit−il, vous et votre capitaine Nemo, vous me
faites pitié !
— Mais nous irons au pôle, maître Ned.
— Possible, mais vous n’en reviendrez pas ! »
Et Ned Land rentra dans sa cabine, « pour ne pas faire un malheur »,
dit−il en me quittant.
Cependant, les préparatifs de cette audacieuse tentative venaient de
commencer. Les puissantes pompes du Nautilus refoulaient l’air dans les
réservoirs et l’emmagasinaient à une haute pression. Vers quatre heures,
le capitaine Nemo m’annonça que les panneaux de la plate−forme allaient
être fermés. Je jetai un dernier regard sur l’épaisse banquise que nous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 398
allions franchir. Le temps était clair, l’atmosphère assez pure, le froid très
vif, douze degrés au−dessous de zéro ; mais le vent s’étant calmé, cette
température ne semblait pas trop insupportable.
Une dizaine d’hommes montèrent sur les flancs du Nautilus et, armés de
pics, ils cassèrent la glace autour de la carène qui fut bientôt dégagée.
Opération rapidement pratiquée, car la jeune glace était mince encore.
Tous nous rentrâmes à l’intérieur. Les réservoirs habituels se remplirent
de cette eau tenue libre à la flottaison. Le Nautilus ne tarda pas à
descendre.
J’avais pris place au salon avec Conseil. Par la vitre ouverte, nous
regardions les couches inférieures de l’Océan austral. Le thermomètre
remontait. L’aiguille du manomètre déviait sur le cadran.
A trois cents mètres environ, ainsi que l’avait prévu le capitaine Nemo,
nous flottions sous la surface ondulée de la banquise. Mais le Nautilus
s’immergea plus bas encore. Il atteignit une profondeur de huit cents
mètres. La température de l’eau, qui donnait douze degrés à la surface,
n’en accusait plus que onze. Deux degrés étaient déjà gagnes. Il va sans
dire que la température du Nautilus, élevée par ses appareils de chauffage,
se maintenait à un degré très supérieur. Toutes les manoeuvres
s’accomplissaient avec une extraordinaire précision.
« On passera, n’en déplaise à monsieur, me dit Conseil.
— J’y compte bien ! » répondis−je avec le ton d’une profonde conviction.
Sous cette mer libre, le Nautilus avait pris directement le chemin de pôle,
sans s’écarter du cinquante−deuxième méridien. De 67°30’à 90°
vingt−deux degrés et demi en latitude restaient à parcourir, c’est−à−dire
un peu plus de cinq cents lieues. Le Nautilus prit une vitesse moyenne de
vingt−six milles à l’heure, la vitesse d’un train express. S’il la conservait,
quarante heures lui suffisaient pour atteindre le pôle.
Pendant une partie de la nuit, la nouveauté de la situation nous retint,
Conseil et moi, à la vitre du salon. La mer s’illuminait sous l’irradiation
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 399
électrique du fanal. Mais elle était déserte. Les poissons ne séjournaient
pas dans ces eaux
prisonnières. Ils ne trouvaient là qu’un passage pour aller de l’Océan
antarctique à la mer libre du pôle. Notre marche était rapide. On la sentait
telle aux tressaillements de la longue coque d’acier.
Vers deux heures du matin, j’allai prendre quelques heures de repos.
Conseil m’imita. En traversant les coursives, je ne rencontrai point le
capitaine Nemo. Je supposai qu’il se tenait dans la cage du timonier.
Le lendemain 19 mars, à cinq heures du matin, je repris mon poste dans le
salon. Le loch électrique m’indiqua que la vitesse du Nautilus avait été
modérée. Il remontait alors vers la surface, mais prudemment, en vidant
lentement ses réservoirs.
Mon coeur battait. Allions−nous émerger et retrouver l’atmosphère libre
du pôle ?
Non. Un choc m’apprit que le Nautilus avait heurté la surface inférieure
de la banquise, très épaisse encore, à en juger par la matité du bruit. En
effet, nous avions « touché » pour employer l’expression marine, mais en
sens inverse et par mille pieds de profondeur. Ce qui donnait deux mille
pieds de glaces au−dessus de nous, dont mille émergeaient. La banquise
présentait alors une hauteur supérieure à celle que nous avions relevée sur
ses bords. Circonstance peu rassurante.
Pendant cette journée, le Nautilus recommença plusieurs fois cette même
expérience, et toujours il vint se heurter contre la muraille qui plafonnait
au−dessus de lui. A de certains instants, il la rencontra par neuf cents
mètres, ce qui accusait douze cents mètres d’épaisseur dont deux cents
mètres s’élevaient au−dessus de la surface de l’Océan. C’était le double
de sa hauteur au moment où le Nautilus s’était enfoncé sous les flots.
Je notai soigneusement ces diverses profondeurs, et j’obtins ainsi le profil
sous−marin de cette chaîne qui se développait sous les eaux.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 400
Le soir, aucun changement n’était survenu dans notre situation. Toujours
la glace entre quatre cents et cinq cents mètres de profondeur. Diminution
évidente, mais quelle épaisseur encore entre nous et la surface de
l’Océan !
Il était huit heures alors. Depuis quatre heures déjà, l’air aurait dû être
renouvelé à l’intérieur du Nautilus, suivant l’habitude quotidienne du
bord. Cependant, je ne souffrais pas trop, bien que le capitaine Nemo
n’eût pas encore demandé à ses réservoirs un supplément d’oxygène.
Mon sommeil fut pénible pendant cette nuit. Espoir et crainte
m’assiégeaient tour à tour. Je me relevai plusieurs fois. Les tâtonnements
du Nautilus continuaient. Vers trois heures du matin, j’observai que la
surface inférieure de la banquise se rencontrait seulement par cinquante
mètres de profondeur. Cent cinquante pieds nous séparaient alors de la
surface des eaux. La banquise redevenait peu à peu ice−field. La
montagne se refaisait la plaine.
Mes yeux ne quittaient plus le manomètre. Nous remontions toujours en
suivant, par une diagonale, la surface resplendissante qui étincelait sous
les rayons électriques. La banquise s’abaissait en dessus et en dessous par
des rampes allongées. Elle s’amincissait de mille en mille.
Enfin, à six heures du matin, ce jour mémorable du 19 mars, la porte du
salon s’ouvrit. Le capitaine Nemo parut.
« La mer libre ! » me dit−il.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
La banquise 401
Le pôle sud
Je me précipitai vers la plate−forme. Oui ! La mer libre. A peine quelques
glaçons épars, des icebergs mobiles ; au loin une mer étendue ; un monde
d’oiseaux dans les airs, et des myriades de poissons sous ces eaux qui,
suivant les fonds, variaient du bleu intense au vert olive. Le thermomètre
marquait trois degrés centigrades au−dessus de zéro. C’était comme un
printemps relatif enfermé derrière cette banquise, dont les masses
éloignées se profilaient sur l’horizon du nord.
« Sommes−nous au pôle ? demandai−je au capitaine, le coeur palpitant.
— Je l’ignore, me répondit−il. A midi nous ferons le point.
— Mais le soleil se montrera−t−il à travers ces brumes ? dis−je en
regardant le ciel grisâtre.
— Si peu qu’il paraisse, il me suffira, répondit le capitaine. »
A dix milles du Nautilus, vers le sud, un îlot solitaire s’élevait à une
hauteur de deux cents mètres. Nous marchions vers lui, prudemment, car
cette mer pouvait être semée d’écueils.
Une heure après, nous avions atteint l’îlot. Deux heures plus tard, nous
achevions d’en faire le tour. Il mesurait quatre à cinq milles de
circonférence. Un étroit canal le séparait d’une terre considérable, un
continent peut−être, dont nous ne pouvions apercevoir les limites.
L’existence de cette terre semblait donner raison aux hypothèses de
Maury. L’ingénieur américain a remarqué, en effet, qu’entre le pôle sud et
le soixantième parallèle, la mer est couverte de glaces flottantes, de
dimensions énormes, qui ne se rencontrent jamais dans l’Atlantique nord.
Le pôle sud 402
De ce fait, il a tiré cette conclusion que le cercle antarctique renferme des
terres considérables, puisque les icebergs ne peuvent se former en pleine
mer, mais seulement sur des côtes. Suivant ses calculs, la masse des glaces
qui enveloppent le pôle austral forme une vaste calotte dont la largeur doit
atteindre quatre mille kilomètres.
Cependant, le Nautilus, par crainte d’échouer, s’était arrêté à trois
encablures d’une grève que dominait un superbe amoncellement de
roches. Le canot fut lancé à la mer. Le capitaine, deux de ses hommes
portant les instruments, Conseil et moi, nous nous y embarquâmes. Il était
dix heures du matin. Je n’avais pas vu Ned Land. Le Canadien, sans doute,
ne voulait pas se désavouer en présence du pôle sud.
Quelques coups d’aviron amenèrent le canot sur le sable, où il s’échoua.
Au moment où Conseil allait sauter à terre, je le retins.
« Monsieur, dis−je au capitaine Nemo, à vous l’honneur de mettre pied le
premier sur cette terre.
— Oui, monsieur, répondit le capitaine, et si je n’hésite pas à fouler ce sol
du pôle, c’est que, jusqu’ici, aucun être humain n’y a laissé la trace de ses
pas. »
Cela dit, il sauta légèrement sur le sable. Une vive émotion lui faisait
battre le coeur. Il gravit un roc qui terminait en surplomb un petit
promontoire, et là, les bras croisés, le regard ardent, immobile, muet, il
sembla prendre possession de ces régions australes. Après cinq minutes
passées dans cette extase, il se retourna vers nous.
« Quand vous voudrez, monsieur », me cria−t−il.
Je débarquai, suivi de Conseil, laissant les deux hommes dans le canot.
Le sol sur un long espace présentait un tuf de couleur rougeâtre, comme
s’il eût été de brique pilée. Des scories, des coulées de lave, des pierres
ponces le recouvraient. On ne pouvait méconnaître son origine
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 403
volcanique. En de certains endroits, quelques légères fumerolles,
dégageant une odeur sulfureuse, attestaient que les feux intérieurs
conservaient encore leur puissance expansive. Cependant, ayant gravi un
haut escarpement, je ne vis aucun volcan dans un rayon de plusieurs
milles. On sait que dans ces contrées antarctiques, James Ross a trouvé les
cratères de l’Érébus et du Terror en pleine activité sur le cent
soixante−septième méridien et par 77°32’de latitude.
La végétation de ce continent désolé me parut extrêmement restreinte.
Quelques lichens de l’espèce Unsnea melanoxantha s’étalaient sur les
roches noires. Certaines plantules microscopiques, des diatomées
rudimentaires, sortes de cellules disposées entre deux coquilles
quartzeuses, de longs fucus pourpres et cramoisis, supportés sur de petites
vessies natatoires et que le ressac jetait à la côte, composaient toute la
maigre flore de cette région.
Le rivage était parsemé de mollusques, de petites moules, de patelles, de
buccardes lisses, en forme de coeurs, et particulièrement de clios au corps
oblong et membraneux, dont la tête est formée de deux lobes arrondis. Je
vis aussi des myriades de ces clios boréales, longues de trois centimètres,
dont la baleine avale un monde à chaque bouchée. Ces charmants
ptéropodes, véritables papillons de la mer, animaient les eaux libres sur la
lisière du rivage.
Entre autres zoophytes apparaissaient dans les hauts−fonds quelques
arborescences coralligènes, de celles qui suivant James Ross, vivent dans
les mers antarctiques jusqu’à mille mètres de profondeur ; puis, de petits
alcyons appartenant à l’espèce procellaria pelagica, ainsi qu’un grand
nombre d’astéries particulières à ces climats, et d’étoiles de mer qui
constellaient le sol.
Mais où la vie surabondait, c’était dans les airs. Là volaient et voletaient
par milliers des oiseaux d’espèces variées, qui nous assourdissaient de
leurs cris. D’autres encombraient les roches, nous regardant passer sans
crainte et se pressant familièrement sous nos pas. C’étaient des pingouins
aussi agiles et souples dans l’eau, où on les a confondus parfois avec de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 404
rapides bonites, qu’ils sont gauches et lourds sur terre. Ils poussaient des
cris baroques et formaient des assemblées nombreuses, sobres de gestes,
mais prodigues de clameurs.
Parmi les oiseaux, je remarquai des chionis, de la famille des échassiers,
gros comme des pigeons, blancs de couleur, le bec court et conique, l’oeil
encadré d’un cercle rouge. Conseil en fit provision, car ces volatiles,
convenablement préparés, forment un mets agréable. Dans les airs
passaient des albatros fuligineux d’une envergure de quatre mètres,
justement appelés les vautours de l’Océan, des pétrels gigantesques, entre
autres des quebrante−huesos, aux ailes arquées, qui sont grands
mangeurs de phoques, des damiers, sortes de petits canards dont le dessus
du corps est noir et blanc, enfin toute une série de pétrels, les uns
blanchâtres, aux ailes bordées de brun, les autres bleus et spéciaux aux
mers antarctiques, ceux−là « si huileux, dis−je à Conseil, que les
habitants des îles Féroé se contentent d’y adapter une mèche avant de les
allumer ».
« Un peu plus, répondit Conseil, ce seraient des lampes parfaites ! Après
ça, on ne peut exiger que la nature les ait préalablement munis d’une
mèche ! »
Après un demi−mille, le sol se montra tout criblé de nids de manchots,
sortes de terriers disposés pour la ponte, et dont s’échappaient de
nombreux oiseaux. Le capitaine Nemo en fit chasser plus tard quelques
centaines, car leur chair noire est très mangeable. Ils poussaient des
braiements d’âne. Ces animaux, de la taille d’une oie, ardoisés sur le
corps, blancs en dessous et cravatés d’un liséré citron, se laissaient tuer à
coups de pierre sans chercher à s’enfuir.
Cependant, la brume ne se levait pas, et, à onze heures, le soleil n’avait
point encore paru. Son absence ne laissait pas de m’inquiéter. Sans lui,
pas d’observations possibles. Comment déterminer alors si nous avions
atteint le pôle ?
Lorsque je rejoignis le capitaine Nemo, je le trouvai silencieusement
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 405
accoudé sur un morceau de roc et regardant le ciel. Il paraissait impatient,
contrarié. Mais qu’y faire ? Cet homme audacieux et puissant ne
commandait pas au soleil comme à la mer.
Midi arriva sans que l’astre du jour se fût montré un seul instant. On ne
pouvait même reconnaître la place qu’il occupait derrière le rideau de
brume. Bientôt cette brume vint à se résoudre en neige.
« A demain », me dit simplement le capitaine, et nous regagnâmes le
Nautilus au milieu des tourbillons de l’atmosphère.
Pendant notre absence, les filets avaient été tendus, et j’observai avec
intérêt les poissons que l’on venait de haler à bord. Les mers antarctiques
servent de refuge à un très grand nombre de migrateurs, qui fuient les
tempêtes des zones moins élevées pour tomber, il est vrai, sous la dent des
marsouins et des phoques. Je notai quelques cottes australes, longs d’un
décimètre, espèce de cartilagineux blanchâtres traversés de bandes livides
et armés d’aiguillons, puis des chimères antarctiques, longues de trois
pieds, le corps très allongé, la peau blanche, argentée et lisse, la tête
arrondie, le dos muni de trois nageoires, le museau terminé par une
trompe qui se recourbe vers la bouche. Je goûtai leur chair, mais je la
trouvai insipide, malgré l’opinion de Conseil qui s’en accommoda fort.
La tempête de neige dura jusqu’au lendemain. Il était impossible de se
tenir sur la plate−forme. Du salon où je notais les incidents de cette
excursion au continent polaire, j’entendais les cris des pétrels et des
albatros qui se jouaient au milieu de la tourmente. Le Nautilus ne resta
pas immobile, et, prolongeant la côte, il s’avança encore d’une dizaine de
milles au sud, au milieu de cette demi−clarté que laissait le soleil en
rasant les bords de l’horizon.
Le lendemain 20 mars, la neige avait cessé. Le froid était un peu plus vif.
Le thermomètre marquait deux degrés au−dessous de zéro. Les brouillards
se levèrent, et j’espérai que, ce jour−là, notre observation pourrait
s’effectuer.
Le capitaine Nemo n’ayant pas encore paru, le canot nous prit, Conseil et
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 406
moi, et nous mit à terre. La nature du sol était la même, volcanique.
Partout des traces de laves, de scories, de basaltes, sans que j’aperçusse le
cratère qui les avait vomis. Ici comme là−bas, des myriades d’oiseaux
animaient cette partie du continent polaire. Mais cet empire, ils le
partageaient alors avec de vastes troupeaux de mammifères marins qui
nousregardaient de leurs doux yeux. C’étaient des phoques d’espèces
diverses, les uns étendus sur le sol, les autres couchés sur des glaçons en
dérive, plusieurs sortant de la mer ou y rentrant. Ils ne se sauvaient pas à
notre approche, n’ayant jamais eu affaire à l’homme, et j’en comptais là
de quoi approvisionner quelques centaines de navires.
« Ma foi, dit Conseil, il est heureux que Ned Land ne nous ait pas
accompagnés !
— Pourquoi cela, Conseil ?
— Parce que l’enragé chasseur aurait tout tué.
— Tout, c’est beaucoup dire, mais je crois, en effet, que nous n’aurions pu
empêcher notre ami le Canadien de harponner quelques−uns de ces
magnifiques cétacés. Ce qui eût désobligé le capitaine Nemo, car il ne
verse pas inutilement le sang des bêtes inoffensives.
— Il a raison.
— Certainement, Conseil. Mais, dis−moi, n’as−tu pas déjà classé ces
superbes échantillons de la faune marine ?
— Monsieur sait bien, répondit Conseil, que je ne suis pas très ferré sur la
pratique. Quand monsieur m’aura appris le nom de ces animaux...
— Ce sont des phoques et des morses.
— Deux genres, qui appartiennent à la famille des pinnipèdes, se hâta de
dire mon savant Conseil, ordre des carnassiers, groupe des unguiculés,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 407
sous−classe des monodelphiens, classe des mammifères, embranchement
des
vertébrés.
— Bien, Conseil, répondis−je, mais ces deux genres, phoques et morses, se
divisent en espèces, et si je ne me trompe, nous aurons ici l’occasion de les
observer. Marchons. »
Il était huit heures du matin. Quatre heures nous restaient à employer
jusqu’au moment où le soleil pourrait être utilement observé. Je dirigeai
nos pas vers une vaste baie qui s’échancrait dans la falaise granitique du
rivage.
Là, je puis dire qu’à perte de vue autour de nous, les terres et les glaçons
étaient encombrés de mammifères marins, et je cherchais involontairement
du regard le vieux Protée, le mythologique pasteur qui gardait ces
immenses troupeaux de Neptune. C’étaient particulièrement des phoques.
Ils formaient des groupes distincts, mâles et femelles, le père veillant sur
sa famille, la mère allaitant ses petits, quelques jeunes, déjà forts,
s’émancipant à quelques pas. Lorsque ces mammifères voulaient se
déplacer, ils allaient par petits sauts dus à la contraction de leur corps, et
ils s’aidaient assez gauchement de leur imparfaite nageoire, qui, chez le
lamantin, leur congénère, forme un véritable avant−bras. Je dois dire que,
dans l’eau, leur élément par excellence, ces animaux à l’épine dorsale
mobile, au bassin étroit, au poil ras et serré, aux pieds palmés, nagent
admirablement. Au repos et sur terre, ils prenaient des attitudes
extrêmement gracieuses. Aussi, les anciens, observant leur physionomie
douce, leur regard expressif que ne saurait surpasser le plus beau regard
de femme, leurs yeux veloutés et limpides, leurs poses charmantes, et les
poétisant à leur manière, métamorphosèrent−ils les mâles en tritons, et les
femelles en sirènes.
Je fis remarquer à Conseil le développement considérable des lobes
cérébraux chez ces intelligents cétacés. Aucun mammifère, l’homme
excepté, n’a la matière cérébrale plus riche. Aussi, les phoques sont−ils
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 408
susceptibles de recevoir une certaine éducation ; ils se domestiquent
aisément, et je pense, avec certains naturalistes, que. convenablement
dressés, ils pourraient rendre de grands services comme chiens de pêche.
La plupart de ces phoques dormaient sur les rochers ou sur le sable.
Parmi ces phoques proprement dits qui n’ont point d’oreilles externes —
différant en cela des otaries dont l’oreille est saillante — j’observai
plusieurs variétés de sténorhynques, longs de trois mètres, blancs de poils,
à têtes de bull−dogs, armés de dix dents à chaque mâchoire, quatre
incisives en haut et en bas et deux grandes canines découpées en forme de
fleur de lis. Entre eux se glissaient des éléphants marins, sortes de phoques
à trompe courte et mobile, les géants de l’espèce, qui sur une
circonférence de vingt pieds mesuraient une longueur de dix mètres. Ils ne
faisaient aucun mouvement à notre approche.
« Ce ne sont pas des animaux dangereux ? me demanda Conseil.
— Non, répondis−je, à moins qu’on ne les attaque. Lorsqu’un phoque
défend son petit, sa fureur est terrible, et il n’est pas rare qu’il mette en
pièces l’embarcation des pêcheurs.
— Il est dans son droit, répliqua Conseil.
— Je ne dis pas non. »
Deux milles plus loin, nous étions arrêtés par le promontoire qui couvrait
la baie contre les vents du sud. Il tombait d’aplomb à la mer et écumait
sous le ressac. Au−delà éclataient de formidables rugissements, tels qu’un
troupeau de ruminants en eût pu produire.
« Bon, fit Conseil, un concert de taureaux ?
— Non, dis−je, un concert de morses. Ils se battent ?
— Ils se battent ou ils jouent.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 409
— N’en déplaise à monsieur, il faut voir cela.
— Il faut le voir, Conseil. »
Et nous voilà franchissant les roches noirâtres, au milieu d’éboulements
imprévus, et sur des pierres que la glace rendait fort glissantes. Plus d’une
fois, je roulai au détriment de mes reins. Conseil, plus prudent ou plus
solide, ne bronchait guère, et me relevait, disant :
« Si monsieur voulait avoir la bonté d’écarter les jambes, monsieur
conserverait mieux son équilibre. »
Arrivé à l’arête supérieure du promontoire, j’aperçus une vaste plaine
blanche, couverte de morses. Ces animaux jouaient entre eux. C’étaient
des hurlements de joie, non de colère.
Les morses ressemblent aux phoques par la forme de leurs corps et par la
disposition de leurs membres. Mais les canines et les incisives manquent à
leur mâchoire inférieure, et quant aux canines supérieures, ce sont deux
défenses longues de quatre−vingts centimètres qui en mesurent
trente−trois à la circonférence de leur alvéole. Ces dents, faites d’un
ivoire compact et sans stries, plus dur que celui des éléphants, et moins
prompt à jaunir, sont très recherchées. Aussi les morses sont−ils en butte à
une chasse inconsidérée qui les détruira bientôt jusqu’au dernier, puisque
les chasseurs, massacrant indistinctement les femelles pleines et les jeunes,
en détruisent chaque année plus de quatre mille.
En passant auprès de ces curieux animaux, je pus les examiner à loisir,
car ils ne se dérangeaient pas. Leur peau était épaisse et rugueuse, d’un
ton fauve tirant sur le roux, leur pelage court et peu fourni. Quelques−uns
avaient une longueur de quatre mètres. Plus tranquilles et moins craintifs
que leurs congénères du nord, ils ne confiaient point à des sentinelles
choisies le soin de surveiller les abords de leur campement.
Après avoir examiné cette cité des morses, je songeai à revenir sur mes
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 410
pas. Il était onze heures, et si le capitaine Nemo se trouvait dans des
conditions favorables pour observer, je voulais être présent à son
opération. Cependant, je n’espérais pas que le soleil se montrât ce
jour−là. Des nuages écrasés sur l’horizon le dérobaient à nos yeux. Il
semblait que cet astre jaloux ne voulût pas révéler à des êtres humains ce
point inabordable du globe.
Cependant, je songeai à revenir vers le Nautilus. Nous suivîmes un étroit
raidillon qui courait sur le sommet de la falaise. A onze heures et demie,
nous étions arrivés au point du débarquement. Le canot échoué avait
déposé le capitaine à terre. Je l’aperçus debout sur un bloc ce basalte. Ses
instruments étaient près de lui. Son regard se fixait sur l’horizon du nord,
près duquel le soleil décrivait alors sa courbe allongée.
Je pris place auprès de lui et j’attendis sans parler. Midi arriva, et, ainsi
que la veille, le soleil ne se montra pas.
C’était une fatalité. L’observation manquait encore. Si demain elle ne
s’accomplissait pas, il faudrait renoncer définitivement à relever notre
situation.
En effet, nous étions précisément au 20 mars. Demain, 21, jour de
l’équinoxe, réfraction non comptée, le soleil disparaîtrait sous l’horizon
pour six mois, et avec sa disparition commencerait la longue nuit polaire.
Depuis l’équinoxe de septembre, il avait émergé de l’horizon
septentrional, s’élevant par des spirales allongées jusqu’au 21 décembre.
A cette époque, solstice d’été de ces contrées boréales, il avait commencé
à redescendre, et le lendemain, il devait leur lancer ses derniers rayons.
Je communiquai mes observations et mes craintes au capitaine Nemo.
« Vous aviez raison, monsieur Aronnax, me dit−il, si demain, je n’obtiens
la hauteur du soleil, je ne pourrai avant six mois reprendre cette
opération. Mais aussi, précisément parce que les hasards de ma
navigation m’ont amené, le 21 mars, dans ces mers, mon point sera facile
à relever, si, à midi, le soleil se montre à nos yeux.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 411
— Pourquoi, capitaine ?
— Parce que, lorsque l’astre du jour décrit des spirales si allongées, il est
difficile de mesurer exactement sa hauteur au−dessus de l’horizon, et les
instruments sont exposés à
commettre de graves erreurs.
— Comment procéderez−vous donc ?
— Je n’emploierai que mon chronomètre, me répondit le capitaine Nemo.
Si demain, 21 mars, à midi, le disque du soleil, en tenant compte de la
réfraction, est coupé exactement par l’horizon du nord, c’est que je suis au
pôle sud.
— En effet, dis−je. Pourtant, cette affirmation n’est pas mathématiquement
rigoureuse, parce que l’équinoxe ne tombe pas nécessairement à midi.
— Sans doute, monsieur, mais l’erreur ne sera pas de cent
mètres, et il ne nous en faut pas davantage. A demain donc. »
Le capitaine Nemo retourna à bord. Conseil et moi, nous restâmes jusqu’à
cinq heures à arpenter la plage, observant et étudiant. Je ne récoltai aucun
objet curieux, si ce n’est un oeuf de pingouin, remarquable par sa
grosseur, et qu’un amateur eût payé plus de mille francs. Sa couleur
isabelle, les raies et les caractères qui l’ornaient comme autant
d’hiéroglyphes, en faisaient un bibelot rare. Je le remis entre les mains de
Conseil, et le prudent garçon, au pied sûr, le tenant comme une précieuse
porcelaine de Chine, le rapporta intact au Nautilus.
Là je déposai cet oeuf rare sous une des vitrines du musée. Je soupai avec
appétit d’un excellent morceau de foie de phoque dont le goût rappelait
celui de la viande de porc. Puis je me couchai, non sans avoir invoqué,
comme un Indou, les faveurs de l’astre radieux.
Le lendemain, 21 mars, dès cinq heures du matin, je montai sur la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 412
plate−forme. J’y trouvai le capitaine Nemo.
« Le temps se dégage un peu, me dit−il. J’ai bon espoir. Après déjeuner,
nous nous rendrons à terre pour choisir un poste d’observation. »
Ce point convenu, j’allai trouver Ned Land. J’aurais voulu l’emmener
avec moi. L’obstiné Canadien refusa, et je vis bien que sa taciturnité
comme sa fâcheuse humeur s’accroissaient de jour en jour. Après tout, je
ne regrettai pas son entêtement dans cette circonstance. Véritablement, il y
avait trop de phoques à terre, et il ne fallait pas soumettre ce pêcheur
irréfléchi à cette tentation.
Le déjeuner terminé, je me rendis à terre. Le Nautilus s’était encore élevé
de quelques milles pendant la nuit. Il était au large, à une grande lieue
d’une côte, que dominait un pic aigu de quatre a cinq cents mètres. Le
canot portait avec moi le capitaine Nemo, deux hommes de l’équipage, et
les instruments, c’est−à−dire un chronomètre, une lunette et un
baromètre.
Pendant notre traversée, je vis de nombreuses baleines qui appartenaient
aux trois espèces particulières aux mers australes, la baleine franche ou «
right−whale » des Anglais, qui n’a pas de nageoire dorsale, le
hump−back, baleinoptère à ventre plissé, aux vastes nageoires
blanchâtres, qui malgré son nom, ne forment pourtant pas des ailes, et le
fin−back, brun−jaunâtre, le plus vif des cétacés. Ce puissant animal se fait
entendre de loin, lorsqu’il projette à une grande hauteur ses colonnes
d’air et de vapeur, qui ressemblent à des tourbillons de fumée. Ces
différents mammifères s’ébattaient par troupes dans les eaux tranquilles,
et je vis bien que ce bassin du pôle antarctique servait maintenant de
refuge aux cétacés trop vivement traqués par les chasseurs.
Je remarquai également de longs cordons blanchâtres de salpes, sortes de
mollusques agrégés, et des méduses de grande taille qui se balançaient
entre le remous des lames.
A neuf heures, nous accostions la terre. Le ciel s’éclaircissait. Les nuages
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 413
fuyaient dans le sud. Les brumes abandonnaient la surface froide des eaux.
Le capitaine Nemo se dirigea vers le pic dont il voulait sans doute faire
son observatoire. Ce fut une ascension pénible sur des laves aiguës et des
pierres ponces, au milieu d’une atmosphère souvent saturée par les
émanations sulfureuses des fumerolles. Le capitaine, pour un homme
déshabitué de fouler la terre, gravissait les pentes les plus raides avec une
souplesse, une agilité que je ne pouvais égaler, et qu’eût enviée un
chasseur d’isards.
Il nous fallut deux heures pour atteindre le sommet de ce pic moitié
porphyre, moitié basalte. De là, nos regards embrassaient une vaste mer
qui, vers le nord traçait nettement sa ligne terminale sur le fond du ciel. A
nos pieds, des champs éblouissants de blancheur. Sur notre tête, un pâle
azur, dégagé de brumes. Au nord, le disque du soleil comme une boule de
feu déjà écornée par le tranchant de l’horizon. Du sein des eaux
s’élevaient en gerbes magnifiques des jets liquides par centaines. Au loin,
le Nautilus, comme un cétacé endormi. Derrière nous, vers le sud et l’est,
une terre immense, un amoncellement chaotique de rochers et de glaces
dont on n’apercevait pas la limite.
Le capitaine Nemo, en arrivant au sommet du pic, releva soigneusement sa
hauteur au moyen du baromètre, car il devait en tenir compte dans son
observation.
A midi moins le quart, le soleil, vu alors par réfraction seulement, se
montra comme un disque d’or et dispersa ses derniers rayons sur ce
continent abandonné, à ces mers que l’homme n’a jamais sillonnées
encore.
Le capitaine Nemo, muni d’une lunette à réticules, qui, au moyen d’un
miroir, corrigeait la réfraction, observa l’astre qui s’enfonçait peu à peu
au−dessous de l’horizon en suivant une diagonale très allongée. Je tenais
le chronomètre. Mon coeur battait fort. Si la disparition du demi−disque
du soleil coïncidait avec le midi du chronomètre, nous étions au pôle
même.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 414
« Midi ! m’écriai−je.
— Le pôle sud ! » répondit le capitaine Nemo d’une voix grave, en me
donnant la lunette qui montrait l’astre du jour précisément coupé en deux
portions égales par l’horizon.
Je regardai les derniers rayons couronner le pic et les ombres monter peu
à peu sur ses rampes.
En ce moment, le capitaine Nemo, appuyant sa main sur mon épaule, me
dit :
« Monsieur, en 1600, le Hollandais Ghéritk, entraîné par les courants et
les tempêtes, atteignit 64° de latitude sud et découvrit les New−Shetland.
En 1773, le 17 janvier, l’illustre Cook, suivant le trente−huitième
méridien, arriva par 67°30’de latitude. et en 1774, le 30 janvier, sur le
cent−neuvième méridien, il atteignit 71°15’de latitude. En 1819, le Russe
Bellinghausen se trouva sur le soixante−neuvième parallèle, et en 1821,
sur le soixante−sixième par 111° de longitude ouest. En 1820, l’Anglais
Brunsfield fut arrêté sur le soixante−cinquième degré. La même année,
l’Américain Morrel, dont les récits sont douteux, remontant sur le
quarante−deuxième méridien, découvrait la mer libre par 70°14’de
latitude. En 1825, l’Anglais Powell ne pouvait dépasser le
soixante−deuxième degré. La même année, un simple pêcheur de phoques,
l’Anglais Weddel s’élevait jusqu’à 72°14’de latitude sur le
trente−cinquième méridien, et jusqu’à 74°15’sur le trente−sixième. En
1829, l’Anglais Forster, commandant le Chanticleer, prenait possession
du continent antarctique par 63°26’de latitude et 66°26’de longitude. En
1831, l’Anglais Biscoë, le ler février, découvrait la terre d’Enderby par
68°50’de latitude, en 1832, le 5 février, la terre d’Adélaïde par 67° de
latitude et le 21 février, la terre de Graham par 64°45’de latitude. En
1838, le Français Dumont d’Urville, arrêté devant la banquise par
62°57’de latitude, relevait la terre Louis−Philippe ; deux ans plus tard,
dans une nouvelle pointe au sud, il nommait par 66°30’, le 21 janvier, la
terre Adélie, et huit jours après, par 64°40’, la côte Clarie. En 1838,
l’Anglais Wilkes s’avançait jusqu’au soixante−neuvième parallèle sur le
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 415
centième méridien. En 1839, l’Anglais Balleny découvrait la terre Sabrina,
sur la limite du cercle polaire. Enfin, en 1842, l’Anglais James Ross,
montant l’Érébus et le Terror, le 12 janvier, par 76°56’de latitude et
171°7’de longitude est, trouvait la terre Victoria ; le 23 du même mois, il
relevait le soixante−quatorzième parallèle, le plus haut point atteint
jusqu’alors ; le 27, il était par 76°8’, le 28, par 77°32’, le 2 février, par
78°4’, et en 1842, il revenait au soixante−onzième degré qu’il ne put
dépasser. Eh bien, moi, capitaine Nemo, ce 21 mars 1868, j’ai atteint le
pôle sud sur le quatre−vingt−dixième degré, et je prends possession de
cette partie du globe égale au sixième des continents reconnus.
— Au nom de qui, capitaine ?
— Au mien, monsieur ! »
Et ce disant, le capitaine Nemo déploya un pavillon noir, portant un N
d’or écartelé sur son étamine. Puis, se retournant vers l’astre du jour dont
les derniers rayons léchaient l’horizon de la mer :
« Adieu, soleil ! s’écria−t−il. Disparais, astre radieux ! Couche−toi sous
cette mer libre. et laisse une nuit de six mois étendre ses ombres sur mon
nouveau domaine ! »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le pôle sud 416
Accident ou incident
Le lendemain, 22 mars, à six heures du matin, les préparatifs de départ
furent commencés. Les dernières lueurs du crépuscule se fondaient dans la
nuit. Le froid était vif. Les constellations resplendissaient avec une
surprenante intensité. Au zénith brillait cette admirable Croix du Sud,
l’étoile polaire des régions antarctiques.
Le thermomètre marquait douze degrés au−dessous de zéro, et quand le
vent fraîchissait, il causait de piquantes morsures. Les glaçons se
multipliaient sur l’eau libre. La mer tendait à se prendre partout. De
nombreuses plaques noirâtres, étalées à sa surface, annonçaient la
prochaine formation de la jeune glace. Évidemment, le bassin austral, gelé
pendant les six mois de l’hiver, était absolument inaccessible. Que
devenaient les baleines pendant cette période ? Sans doute, elles allaient
par−dessous la banquise chercher des mers plus praticables. Pour les
phoques et les morses, habitués à vivre sous les plus durs climats, ils
restaient sur ces parages glacés. Ces animaux ont l’instinct de creuser des
trous dans les ice−fields et de les maintenir toujours ouverts. C’est à ces
trous qu’ils viennent respirer ; quand les oiseaux, chassés par le froid, ont
émigré vers le nord, ces mammifères marins demeurent les seuls maîtres
du continent polaire.
Cependant, les réservoirs d’eau s’étaient remplis, et le Nautilus descendait
lentement. A une profondeur de mille pieds, il s’arrêta. Son hélice battit les
flots, et il s’avança droit au nord avec une vitesse de quinze milles à
l’heure. Vers le soir, il flottait déjà sous l’immense carapace glacée de la
banquise.
Les panneaux du salon avaient été fermés par prudence, car la coque du
Nautilus pouvait se heurter à quelque bloc immergé. Aussi, je passai cette
journée à mettre mes notes au net. Mon esprit était tout entier à ses
Accident ou incident 417
souvenirs du pôle. Nous avions atteint ce point inaccessible sans fatigues,
sans danger, comme si notre wagon flottant eût glissé sur les rails d’un
chemin de fer. Et maintenant, le retour commençait véritablement. Me
réserverait−il encore de pareilles surprises ? Je le pensais, tant la série
des merveilles sous−marines est inépuisable ! Cependant, depuis cinq
mois et demi que le hasard nous avait jetés à ce bord, nous avions franchi
quatorze mille lieues, et sur ce parcours plus étendu que l’Équateur
terrestre, combien d’incidents ou curieux ou terribles avaient charmé
notre voyage : la chasse dans les forêts de Crespo, l’échouement du détroit
de Torrès, le cimetière de corail, les pêcheries de Ceylan, le tunnel
arabique, les feux de Santorin, les millions de la baie du Vigo, l’Atlantide,
le pôle sud ! Pendant la nuit, tous ces souvenirs, passant de rêve en rêve,
ne laissèrent pas mon cerveau sommeiller un instant.
A trois heures du matin, je fus réveillé par un choc violent. Je m’étais
redressé sur mon lit et j’écoutais au milieu de l’obscurité, quand je fus
précipité brusquement au milieu de la chambre. Évidemment, le Nautilus
donnait une bande considérable après avoir touché.
Je m’accotai aux parois et je me traînai par les coursives jusqu’au salon
qu’éclairait le plafond lumineux. Les meubles étaient renversés.
Heureusement, les vitrines, solidement saisies par le pied, avaient tenu
bon. Les tableaux de tribord, sous le déplacement de la verticale se
collaient aux tapisseries, tandis que ceux de bâbord s’en écartaient d’un
pied par leur bordure inférieure. Le Nautilus était donc couché sur
tribord, et, de plus, complètement immobile.
A l’intérieur j’entendais un bruit de pas, des voix confuses. Mais le
capitaine Nemo ne parut pas. Au moment où j’allais quitter le salon, Ned
Land et Conseil entrèrent.
« Qu’y a−t−il ? leur dis−je aussitôt.
— Je venais le demander à monsieur, répondit Conseil.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 418
— Mille diables ! s’écria le Canadien, je le sais bien moi ! LeNautilusa
touché, et à en juger par la gîte qu’il donne, je ne crois pas qu’il s’en tire
comme la première fois dans le détroit de Torrès.
— Mais au moins, demandai−je, est−il revenu à la surface de la mer ?
— Nous l’ignorons, répondit Conseil.
— Il est facile de s’en assurer », répondis−je.
Je consultai le manomètre. A ma grande surprise, il indiquait une
profondeur de trois cent soixante mètres.
« Qu’est−ce que cela veut dire ? m’écriai−je.
— Il faut interroger le capitaine Nemo, dit Conseil.
— Mais où le trouver ? demanda Ned Land.
— Suivez−moi », dis−je à mes deux compagnons.
Nous quittâmes le salon. Dans la bibliothèque, personne. A l’escalier
central, au poste de l’équipage, personne. Je supposai que le capitaine
Nemo devait être posté dans la cage du timonier. Le mieux était
d’attendre. Nous revînmes tous trois au salon.
Je passerai sous silence les récriminations du Canadien. Il avait beau jeu
pour s’emporter. Je le laissai exhaler sa mauvaise humeur tout à son aise,
sans lui répondre.
Nous étions ainsi depuis vingt minutes, cherchant à surprendre les
moindres bruits qui se produisaient à l’intérieur du Nautilus, quand le
capitaine Nemo entra. Il ne sembla pas nous voir. Sa physionomie,
habituellement si impassible, révélait une certaine inquiétude. Il observa
silencieusement la boussole, le manomètre, et vint poser son doigt sur un
point du planisphère, dans cette partie qui représentait les mers australes.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 419
Je ne voulus pas l’interrompre. Seulement, quelques instants plus tard,
lorsqu’il se tourna vers moi, je lui dis en retournant contre lui une
expression dont il s’était servi au détroit de Torrès :
« Un incident, capitaine ?
— Non, monsieur, répondit−il, un accident cette fois.
— Grave ?
— Peut−être.
— Le danger est−il immédiat ?
— Non.
— Le Nautilus s’est échoué ?
— Oui.
— Et cet échouement est venu ? ...
— D’un caprice de la nature, non de l’impéritie des hommes. Pas une
faute n’a été commise dans nos manoeuvres. Toutefois, on ne saurait
empêcher l’équilibre de produire ses effets. On peut braver les lois
humaines, mais non résister aux lois naturelles. »
Singulier moment que choisissait le capitaine Nemo pour se livrer à cette
réflexion philosophique. En somme, sa réponse ne m’apprenait rien.
« Puis−je savoir, monsieur, lui demandai−je, quelle est la cause de cet
accident ?
— Un énorme bloc de glace, une montagne entière s’est retournée, me
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 420
répondit−il. Lorsque les icebergs sont minés à leur base par des eaux plus
chaudes ou par des chocs réitérés, leur centre de gravité remonte. Alors ils
se retournent en grand, ils culbutent. C’est ce qui est arrivé. L’un de ces
blocs, en se renversant, a heurté le Nautilus qui flottait sous les eaux. Puis,
glissant sous sa coque et le relevant avec une irrésistible force, il l’a
ramené dans des couches moins denses, où il se trouve couché sur le flanc.
Mais ne peut−on dégager le Nautilus en vidant ses réservoirs, de manière
à le remettre en équilibre ?
— C’est ce qui se fait en ce moment, monsieur. Vous pouvez entendre les
pompes fonctionner. Voyez l’aiguille du manomètre. Elle indique que le
Nautilus remonte, mais le bloc de glace remonte avec lui, et jusqu’à ce
qu’un obstacle arrête son mouvement ascensionnel, notre position ne sera
pas changée. »
En effet, le Nautilus donnait toujours la même bande sur tribord. Sans
doute, il se redresserait, lorsque le bloc s’arrêterait lui−même. Mais à ce
moment, qui sait si nous n’aurions pas heurté la partie supérieure de la
banquise, si nous ne serions pas effroyablement pressés entre les deux
surfaces glacées ?
Je réfléchissais à toutes les conséquences de cette situation. Le capitaine
Nemo ne cessait d’observer le manomètre. Le Nautilus, depuis la chute de
l’iceberg, avait remonté de cent cinquante pieds environ, mais il faisait
toujours le même angle avec la perpendiculaire.
Soudain un léger mouvement se fit sentir dans la coque. Évidemment, le
Nautilus se redressait un peu. Les objets suspendus dans le salon
reprenaient sensiblement leur position normale. Les parois se
rapprochaient de la verticalité. Personne de nous ne parlait. Le coeur
ému, nous observions, nous sentions le redressement. Le plancher
redevenait horizontal sous nos pieds. Dix minutes s’écoulèrent.
« Enfin, nous sommes droit ! m’écria−je.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 421
— Oui, dit le capitaine Nemo, se dirigeant vers la porte du salon.
— Mais flotterons−nous ? lui demandai−je.
— Certainement, répondit−il, puisque les réservoirs ne sont pas encore
vidés, et que vidés, le Nautilus devra remonter à la surface de la mer. »
Le capitaine sortit, et je vis bientôt que, par ses ordres, on avait arrêté la
marche ascensionnelle du Nautilus. En effet, il aurait bientôt heurté la
partie inférieure de la banquise, et mieux valait le maintenir entre deux
eaux.
« Nous l’avons échappé belle ! dit alors Conseil.
— Oui. Nous pouvions être écrasés entre ces blocs de glace, ou tout au
moins emprisonnés. Et alors, faute de pouvoir renouveler l’air... Oui !
nous l’avons échappé belle !
— Si c’est fini ! » murmura Ned Land.
Je ne voulus pas entamer avec le Canadien une discussion sans utilité, et
je ne répondis pas. D’ailleurs, les panneaux s’ouvrirent en ce moment, et
la lumière extérieure fit irruption à travers la vitre dégagée.
Nous étions en pleine eau, ainsi que je l’ai dit ; mais, à une distance de dix
mètres, sur chaque côté du Nautilus, s’élevait une éblouissante muraille de
glace. Au−dessus et au−dessous, même muraille. Au−dessus, parce que la
surface inférieure de la banquise se développait comme un plafond
immense. Au−dessous, parce que le bloc culbuté, ayant glissé peu à peu,
avait trouvé sur les murailles latérales deux points d’appui qui le
maintenaient dans cette position. Le Nautilus était emprisonné dans un
véritable tunnel de glace, d’une largeur de vingt mètres environ, rempli
d’une eau tranquille. Il lui était donc facile d’en sortir en marchant soit en
avant soit en arrière, et de reprendre ensuite, à quelques centaines de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 422
mètres plus bas, un libre passage sous la banquise.
Le plafond lumineux avait été éteint, et cependant, le salon resplendissait
d’une lumière intense. C’est que la puissante réverbération des parois de
glace y renvoyait violemment les nappes du fanal. Je ne saurais peindre
l’effet des rayons voltaïques sur ces grands blocs capricieusement
découpés, dont chaque angle, chaque arête, chaque facette, jetait une
lueur différente, suivant la nature des veines qui couraient dans la glace.
Mine éblouissante de gemmes, et particulièrement de saphirs qui
croisaient leurs jets bleus avec le jet vert des émeraudes. Çà et là des
nuances opalines d’une douceur infinie couraient au milieu de points
ardents comme autant de diamants de feu dont l’oeil ne pouvait soutenir
l’éclat. La puissance du fanal était centuplée, comme celle d’une lampe à
travers les lames lenticulaires d’un phare de premier ordre.
« Que c’est beau ! Que c’est beau ! s’écria Conseil.
— Oui ! dis−je, c’est un admirable spectacle. N’est−ce pas, Ned ?
— Eh ! mille diables ! oui, riposta Ned Land. C’est superbe ! Je rage
d’être forcé d’en convenir. On n’a jamais rien vu de pareil. Mais ce
spectacle−là pourra nous coûter cher. Et, s’il faut tout dire, je pense que
nous voyons ici des choses que Dieu a voulu interdire aux regards de
l’homme ! »
Ned avait raison. C’était trop beau. Tout à coup, un cri de Conseil me fit
retourner.
« Qu’y a−t−il ? demandai−je.
— Que monsieur ferme les yeux ! que monsieur ne regarde pas ! »
Conseil, ce disant, appliquait vivement ses mains sur ses paupières.
« Mais qu’as−tu, mon garçon ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 423
— Je suis ébloui, aveuglé ! »
Mes regards se portèrent involontairement vers la vitre, mais je ne pus
supporter le feu qui la dévorait.
Je compris ce qui s’était passé. Le Nautilus venait de se mettre en marche
à grande vitesse. Tous les éclats tranquilles des murailles de glace
s’étaient alors changés en raies fulgurantes. Les feux de ces myriades de
diamants se confondaient. Le Nautilus, emporté par son hélice, voyageait
dans un fourreau d’éclairs.
Les panneaux du salon se refermèrent alors. Nous tenions nos mains sur
nos yeux tout imprégnés de ces lueurs concentriques qui flottent devant la
rétine, lorsque les rayons solaires l’ont trop violemment frappée. Il fallut
un certain temps pour calmer le trouble de nos regards.
Enfin, nos mains s’abaissèrent.
« Ma foi, je ne l’aurais jamais cru, dit Conseil.
— Et moi, je ne le crois pas encore ! riposta le Canadien.
— Quand nous reviendrons sur terre, ajouta Conseil, blasés sur tant de
merveilles de la nature, que penserons−nous de ces misérables continents
et des petits ouvrages sortis de la main des hommes ! Non ! le monde
habité n’est plus digne de nous!»
De telles paroles dans la bouche d’un impassible Flamand montrent à quel
degré d’ébullition était monté notre enthousiasme. Mais le Canadien ne
manqua pas d’y jeter sa goutte d’eau froide.
« Le monde habité ! dit−il en secouant la tête. Soyez tranquille, ami
Conseil, nous n’y reviendrons pas ! »
Il était alors cinq heures du matin. En ce moment, un choc se produisit à
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 424
l’avant du Nautilus. Je compris que son éperon venait de heurter un bloc
de glace. Ce devait être une fausse manoeuvre, car ce tunnel sous−marin,
obstrué de blocs, n’offrait pas une navigation facile. Je pensai donc que le
capitaine Nemo, modifiant sa route, tournerait ces obstacles ou suivrait les
sinuosités du tunnel. En tout cas, la marche en avant ne pouvait être
absolument enrayée. Toutefois, contre mon attente, le Nautilus prit un
mouvement rétrograde très prononcé.
« Nous revenons en arrière ? dit Conseil.
— Oui, répondis−je. Il faut que, de ce côté, le tunnel soit sans issue.
— Et alors ? ...
— Alors, dis−je, la manoeuvre est bien simple. Nous retournerons sur nos
pas, et nous sortirons par l’orifice sud. Voilà tout. »
En parlant ainsi, je voulais paraître plus rassuré que je ne l’étais
réellement. Cependant le mouvement rétrograde du Nautilus s’accélérait,
et marchant à contre hélice, il nous entraînait avec une grande rapidité.
« Ce sera un retard, dit Ned.
— Qu’importe, quelques heures de plus ou de moins, pourvu qu’on sorte.
— Oui, répéta Ned Land, pourvu qu’on sorte ! »
Je me promenai pendant quelques instants du salon à la bibliothèque. Mes
compagnons assis, se taisaient. Je me jetai bientôt sur un divan, et je pris
un livre que mes yeux parcoururent machinalement.
Un quart d’heure après, Conseil, s’étant approché de moi, me dit :
« Est−ce bien intéressant ce que lit monsieur ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 425
— Très intéressant, répondis−je.
— Je le crois. C’est le livre de monsieur que lit monsieur !
— Mon livre ? »
En effet, je tenais à la main l’ouvrage des Grands Fonds sous−marins. Je
ne m’en doutais même pas. Je fermai le livre et repris ma promenade. Ned
et Conseil se levèrent pour se retirer.
« Restez, mes amis, dis−je en les retenant. Restons ensemble jusqu’au
moment où nous serons sortis de cette impasse.
— Comme il plaira à monsieur », répondit Conseil.
Quelques heures s’écoulèrent. J’observais souvent les instruments
suspendus à la paroi du salon. Le manomètre indiquait que le Nautilus se
maintenait à une profondeur constante de trois cents mètres, la boussole.
qu’il se dirigeait toujours au sud, le loch, qu’il marchait à une vitesse de
vingt milles à l’heure, vitesse excessive dans un espace aussi resserré.
Mais le capitaine Nemo savait qu’il ne pouvait trop se hâter, et qu’alors,
les minutes valaient des siècles.
A huit heures vingt−cinq, un second choc eut lieu. A l’arrière, cette fois. Je
pâlis. Mes compagnons s’étaient rapprochés de moi. J’avais saisi la main
de Conseil. Nous nous interrogions du regard, et plus directement que si
les mots eussent interprété notre pensée.
En ce moment, le capitaine entra dans le salon. J’allai à lui.
« La route est barrée au sud ? lui demandai−je.
— Oui, monsieur. L’iceberg en se retournant a fermé toute issue.
— Nous sommes bloqués ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 426
— Oui. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Accident ou incident 427
Faute d'air
Ainsi, autour du Nautilus, au−dessus, au−dessous, un impénétrable mur
de glace. Nous étions prisonniers de la banquise ! Le Canadien avait
frappé une table de son formidable poing. Conseil se taisait. Je regardai le
capitaine. Sa figure avait repris son impassibilité habituelle. Il s’était
croisé les bras. Il réfléchissait. Le Nautilus ne bougeait plus.
Le capitaine prit alors la parole :
« Messieurs, dit−il d’une voix calme, il y a deux manières de mourir dans
les conditions où nous sommes. »
Cet inexplicable personnage avait l’air d’un professeur de mathématiques
qui fait une démonstration à ses élèves.
« La première, reprit−il, c’est de mourir écrasés. La seconde, c’est de
mourir asphyxiés. Je ne parle pas de la possibilité de mourir de faim, car
les approvisionnements du Nautilus dureront certainement plus que nous.
Préoccupons−nous donc des chances d’écrasement ou d’asphyxie.
— Quant à l’asphyxie, capitaine, répondis−je, elle n’est pas à craindre,
car nos réservoirs sont pleins.
— Juste, reprit le capitaine Nemo, mais ils ne donneront que deux jours
d’air. Or, voilà trente−six heures que nous sommes enfouis sous les eaux,
et déjà l’atmosphère alourdie du Nautilus demande à être renouvelée.
Dans quarante−huit heures, notre réserve sera épuisée.
— Eh bien, capitaine, soyons délivrés avant quarante−huit heures !
— Nous le tenterons, du moins, en perçant la muraille qui nous entoure.
Faute d'air 428
— De quel côté ? demandai−je.
— C’est ce que la sonde nous apprendra. Je vais échouer le Nautilus sur le
banc inférieur, et mes hommes, revêtus de scaphandres, attaqueront
l’iceberg par sa paroi la moins épaisse.
— Peut−on ouvrir les panneaux du salon ?
— Sans inconvénient. Nous ne marchons plus. »
Le capitaine Nemo sortit. Bientôt des sifflements m’apprirent que l’eau
s’introduisait dans les réservoirs. Le Nautilus s’abaissa lentement et
reposa sur le fond de glace par une profondeur de trois cent cinquante
mètres, profondeur à laquelle était immergé le banc de glace inférieur.
« Mes amis, dis−je, la situation est grave, mais je compte sur votre
courage et sur votre énergie.
— Monsieur, me répondit le Canadien, ce n’est pas dans ce moment que je
vous ennuierai de mes récriminations. Je suis prêt à tout faire pour le salut
commun.
— Bien, Ned, dis−je en tendant la main au Canadien.
— J’ajouterai, reprit−il, qu’habile à manier le pic comme le harpon, si je
puis être utile au capitaine, il peut disposer de moi.
— Il ne refusera pas votre aide. Venez, Ned. »
Je conduisis le Canadien à la chambre ou les hommes du Nautilus
revêtaient leurs scaphandres. Je fis part au capitaine de la proposition de
Ned, qui fut acceptée. Le Canadien endossa son costume de mer et fut
aussitôt prêt que ses compagnons de travail. Chacun d’eux portait sur son
dos l’appareil Rouquayrol auquel les réservoirs avaient fourni un large
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 429
continent d’air pur. Emprunt considérable, mais nécessaire, fait à la
réserve du Nautilus. Quant aux lampes Ruhmkorff, elles devenaient
inutiles au milieu de ces eaux lumineuses et saturées de rayons électriques.
Lorsque Ned fut habillé, je rentrai dans le salon dont les vitres étaient
découvertes, et, posté près de Conseil. j’examinai les couches ambiantes
qui supportaient le Nautilus.
Quelques instants après, nous voyions une douzaine d’hommes de
l’équipage prendre pied sur le banc de glace, et parmi eux Ned Land,
reconnaissable à sa haute taille. Le capitaine Nemo était avec eux.
Avant de procéder au creusement des murailles, il fit pratiquer des
sondages qui devaient assurer la bonne direction des travaux. De longues
sondes furent enfoncées dans les parois latérales ; mais après quinze
mètres, elles étaient encore arrêtées par l’épaisse muraille. Il était inutile
de s’attaquer à la surface plafonnante, puisque c’était la banquise
elle−même qui mesurait plus de quatre cents mètres de hauteur. Le
capitaine Nemo fit alors sonder la surface inférieure. Là dix mètres de
parois nous séparaient de l’eau. Telle était l’épaisseur de cet ice−field.
Dès lors, il s’agissait d’en découper un morceau égal en superficie à la
ligne de flottaison du Nautilus. C’était environ six mille cinq cents mètres
cubes à détacher, afin de creuser un trou par lequel nous descendrions
au−dessous du champ de glace.
Le travail fut immédiatement commencé et conduit avec une infatigable
opiniâtreté. Au lieu de creuser autour du Nautilus, ce qui eût entraîné de
plus grandes difficultés, le capitaine Nemo fit dessiner l’immense fosse à
huit mètres de sa hanche de bâbord. Puis ses hommes la taraudèrent
simultanément sur plusieurs points de sa circonférence. Bientôt. Le pic
attaqua vigoureusement cette matière compacte, et de gros blocs furent
détachés de la masse. Par un curieux effet de pesanteur spécifique, ces
blocs, moins lourds que l’eau, s’envolaient pour ainsi dire à la voûte du
tunnel. qui s’épaississait par le haut de ce dont il diminuait vers le bas.
Mais peu importait, du moment que la paroi inférieure s’amincissait
d’autant.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 430
Après deux heures d’un travail énergique, Ned Land rentra épuisé. Ses
compagnons et lui furent remplacés par de nouveaux travailleurs auxquels
nous nous joignîmes, Conseil et moi. Le second du Nautilus nous dirigeait.
L’eau me parut singulièrement froide, mais je me réchauffai promptement
en maniant le pic. Mes mouvements étaient très libres, bien qu’ils se
produisissent sous une pression de trente atmosphères.
Quand je rentrai, après deux heures de travail, pour prendre quelque
nourriture et quelque repos, je trouvai une notable différence entre le
fluide pur que me fournissait l’appareil Rouquayrol et l’atmosphère du
Nautilus, déjà chargé d’acide carbonique. L’air n’avait pas été renouvelé
depuis quarante−huit heures, et ses qualités vivifiantes étaient
considérablement affaiblies. Cependant, en un laps de douze heures, nous
n’avions enlevé qu’une tranche de glace épaisse d’un mètre sur la
superficie dessinée, soit environ six cents mètres cubes. En admettant que
le même travail fût accompli par douze heures, il fallait encore cinq nuits
et quatre jours pour mener à bonne fin cette entreprise.
« Cinq nuits et quatre jours ! dis−je à mes compagnons, et nous n’avons
que pour deux jours d’air dans les réservoirs.
— Sans compter, répliqua Ned, qu’une fois sortis de cette damnée prison,
nous serons encore emprisonnés sous la banquise et sans communication
possible avec l’atmosphère ! »
Réflexion juste. Qui pouvait alors prévoir le minimum de temps nécessaire
à notre délivrance ? L’asphyxie ne nous aurait−elle pas étouffés avant que
le Nautilus eût pu revenir à la surface des flots ? Était−il destiné à périr
dans ce tombeau de glace avec tous ceux qu’il renfermait ? La situation
paraissait terrible. Mais chacun l’avait envisagée en face, et tous étaient
décidés à faire leur devoir jusqu’au bout.
Suivant mes prévisions, pendant la nuit, une nouvelle tranche d’un mètre
fut enlevée à l’immense alvéole. Mais, le matin, quand, revêtu de mon
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 431
scaphandre, je parcourus la masse liquide par une température de six à
sept degrés au−dessous de zéro, je remarquai que les murailles latérales
se rapprochaient peu à peu. Les couches d’eau éloignées de la fosse, que
n’échauffaient pas le travail des hommes et le jeu des outils, marquaient
une tendance à se solidifier. En présence de ce nouveau et imminent
danger, que devenaient nos chances de salut, et comment empêcher la
solidification de ce milieu liquide, qui eût fait éclater comme du verre les
parois du Nautilus ?
Je ne fis point connaître ce nouveau danger à mes deux compagnons. A
quoi bon risquer d’abattre cette énergie qu’ils employaient au pénible
travail du sauvetage ? Mais, lorsque je fus revenu à bord ? je fis observer
au capitaine Nemo cette grave complication.
« Je le sais, me dit−il de ce ton calme que ne pouvaient modifier les plus
terribles conjonctures. C’est un danger de plus, mais je ne vois aucun
moyen d’y parer. La seule chance de salut, c’est d’aller plus vite que la
solidification. Il s’agit d’arriver premiers. Voilà tout. »
Arriver premiers ! Enfin, j’aurais dû être habitué à ces façons de parler !
Cette journée, pendant plusieurs heures, je maniai le pic avec opiniâtreté.
Ce travail me soutenait. D’ailleurs, travailler, c’était quitter le Nautilus,
c’était respirer directement cet air pur emprunté aux réservoirs et fourni
par les appareils, c’était abandonner une atmosphère appauvrie et viciée.
Vers le soir, la fosse s’était encore creusée d’un mètre. Quand je rentrai à
bord, je faillis être asphyxié par l’acide carbonique dont l’air était saturé.
Ah ! que n’avions−nous les moyens chimiques qui eussent permis de
chasser ce gaz délétère ! L’oxygène ne nous manquait pas. Toute cette eau
en contenait une quantité considérable et en la décomposant par nos
puissantes piles, elle nous eût restitué le fluide vivifiant. J’y avais bien
songé, mais à quoi bon, puisque l’acide carbonique, produit de notre
respiration, avait envahi toutes les parties du navire. Pour l’absorber, il
eût fallu remplir des récipients de potasse caustique et les agiter
incessamment. Or, cette matière manquait à bord, et rien ne la pouvait
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 432
remplacer.
Ce soir−là, le capitaine Nemo dut ouvrir les robinets de ses réservoirs, et
lancer quelques colonnes d’air pur à l’intérieur du Nautilus. Sans cette
précaution, nous ne nous serions pas réveillés.
Le lendemain, 26 mars, je repris mon travail de mineur en entamant le
cinquième mètre. Les parois latérales et la surface inférieure de la
banquise s’épaississaient visiblement. Il était évident qu’elles se
rejoindraient avant que le Nautilus fût parvenu à se dégager. Le désespoir
me prit un instant. Mon pic fut près de s’échapper de mes mains. A quoi
bon creuser, si je devais périr étouffé, écrasé par cette eau qui se faisait
pierre, un supplice que la férocité des sauvages n’eût pas même inventé. Il
me semblait que j’étais entre les formidables mâchoires d’un monstre qui
se rapprochaient irrésistiblement.
En ce moment, le capitaine Nemo, dirigeant le travail, travaillant
lui−même, passa près de moi. Je le touchai de la main et lui montrai les
parois de notre prison. La muraille de tribord s’était avancée à moins de
quatre mètres de la coque du Nautilus.
Le capitaine me comprit et me fit signe de le suivre. Nous rentrâmes à
bord. Mon scaphandre ôté, je l’accompagnai dans le salon.
« Monsieur Aronnax, me dit−il, il faut tenter quelque héroïque moyen, ou
nous allons être scellés dans cette eau solidifiée comme dans du ciment.
— Oui ! dis−je, mais que faire ?
— Ah ! s’écria−t−il, si mon Nautilus était assez fort pour supporter cette
pression sans en être écrasé ?
— Eh bien ? demandai−je, ne saisissant pas l’idée du capitaine.
— Ne comprenez−vous pas, reprit−il, que cette congélation de l’eau nous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 433
viendrait en aide ! Ne voyez−vous pas que par sa solidification, elle ferait
éclater ces champs de glace qui nous emprisonnent, comme elle fait, en se
gelant, éclater les pierres les plus dures ! Ne sentez−vous pas qu’elle
serait un agent de salut au lieu d’être un agent de destruction !
— Oui, capitaine, peut−être. Mais quelque résistance à l’écrasement que
possède le Nautilus, il ne pourrait supporter cette épouvantable pression et
s’aplatirait comme une feuille de tôle.
— Je le sais, monsieur. Il ne faut donc pas compter sur les secours de la
nature, mais sur nous−mêmes. Il faut s’opposer à cette solidification. Il
faut l’enrayer. Non seulement, les parois latérales se resserrent, mais il ne
reste pas dix pieds d’eau à l’avant ou à l’arrière du Nautilus. La
congélation nous gagne de tous les côtés.
— Combien de temps, demandai−je, l’air des réservoirs nous
permettra−t−il de respirer à bord ? »
Le capitaine me regarda en face.
« Après−demain, dit−il, les réservoirs seront vides ! »
Une sueur froide m’envahit. Et cependant, devais−je m’étonner de cette
réponse ? Le 22 mars, le Nautilus s’était plongé sous les eaux libres du
pôle. Nous étions au 26. Depuis cinq jours, nous vivions sur les réserves
du bord ! Et ce qui restait d’air respirable, il fallait le conserver aux
travailleurs. Au moment où j’écris ces choses, mon impression est
tellement vive encore, qu’une terreur involontaire s’empare de tout mon
être, et que l’air semble manquer à mes poumons !
Cependant, le capitaine Nemo réfléchissait, silencieux, immobile.
Visiblement, une idée lui traversait l’esprit. Mais il paraissait la
repousser. Il se répondait négativement à lui−même. Enfin, ces mots
s’échappèrent de ses lèvres !
« L’eau bouillante ! murmura−t−il.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 434
— L’eau bouillante ? m’écriai−je.
— Oui, monsieur. Nous sommes renfermés dans un espace relativement
restreint. Est−ce que des jets d’eau bouillante, constamment injectée par
les pompes du Nautilus, n’élèveraient pas la température de ce milieu et ne
retarderaient pas sa congélation ?
— Il faut l’essayer, dis−je résolument.
— Essayons, monsieur le professeur. »
Le thermomètre marquait alors moins sept degrés à l’extérieur. Le
capitaine Nemo me conduisit aux cuisines où fonctionnaient de vastes
appareils distillatoires qui fournissaient l’eau potable par évaporation. Ils
se chargèrent d’eau, et toute la chaleur électrique des piles fut lancée à
travers les serpentins baignés par le liquide. En quelques minutes, cette
eau avait atteint cent degrés. Elle fut dirigée vers les pompes pendant
qu’une eau nouvelle la remplaçait au fur et à mesure. La chaleur
développée par les piles était telle que l’eau froide, puisée à la mer, après
avoir seulement traversé les appareils, arrivait bouillante aux corps de
pompe.
L’injection commença, et trois heures après, le thermomètre marquait
extérieurement six degrés au−dessous de zéro. C’était un degré de gagné.
Deux heures plus tard, le thermomètre n’en marquait que quatre.
« Nous réussirons, dis−je au capitaine, après avoir suivi et contrôlé par de
nombreuses remarques les progrès de l’opération.
— Je le pense, me répondit−il. Nous ne serons pas écrasés. Nous n’avons
plus que l’asphyxie à craindre. »
Pendant la nuit, la température de l’eau remonta a un degré au−dessous
de zéro. Les injections ne purent la porter à un point plus élevé. Mais
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 435
comme la congélation de l’eau de mer ne se produit qu’à moins deux
degrés, je fus enfin rassuré contre les dangers de la solidification.
Le lendemain, 27 mars, six mètres de glace avaient été arrachés de
l’alvéole. Quatre mètres seulement restaient à enlever. C’étaient encore
quarante−huit heures de travail. L’air ne pouvait plus être renouvelé à
l’intérieur du Nautilus. Aussi, cette journée alla−t−elle toujours en
empirant.
Une lourdeur intolérable m’accabla. Vers trois heures du soir, ce
sentiment d’angoisse fut porté en moi à un degré violent. Des bâillements
me disloquaient les mâchoires. Mes poumons haletaient en cherchant ce
fluide comburant, indispensable à la respiration, et qui se raréfiait de plus
en plus. Une torpeur morale s’empara de moi. J’étais étendu sans force,
presque sans connaissance. Mon brave Conseil, pris des mêmes
symptômes, souffrant des mêmes souffrances, ne me quittait plus. Il me
prenait la main, il m’encourageait, et je l’entendais encore murmurer :
« Ah ! si je pouvais ne pas respirer pour laisser plus d’air à monsieur ! »
Les larmes me venaient aux yeux de l’entendre parler ainsi.
Si notre situation, à tous, était intolérable à l’intérieur, avec quelle hâte,
avec quel bonheur, nous revêtions nos scaphandres pour travailler à notre
tour ! Les pics résonnaient sur la couche glacée. Les bras se fatiguaient,
les mains s’écorchaient, mais qu’étaient ces fatigues, qu’importaient ces
blessures ! L’air vital arrivait aux poumons ! On respirait ! On respirait !
Et cependant, personne ne prolongeait au−delà du temps voulu son travail
sous les eaux. Sa tâche accomplie, chacun remettait à ses compagnons
haletants le réservoir qui devait lui verser la vie. Le capitaine Nemo
donnait l’exemple et se soumettait le premier à cette sévère discipline.
L’heure arrivait, il cédait son appareil à un autre et rentrait dans
l’atmosphère viciée du bord, toujours calme, sans une défaillance, sans un
murmure.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 436
Ce jour−là, le travail habituel fut accompli avec plus de vigueur encore.
Deux mètres seulement restaient à enlever sur toute la superficie. Deux
mètres seulement nous séparaient de la mer libre. Mais les réservoirs
étaient presque vides d’air. Le peu qui restait devait être conservé aux
travailleurs. Pas un atome pour le Nautilus !
Lorsque je rentrai à bord, je fus à demi suffoqué. Quelle nuit ! Je ne
saurais la peindre. De telles souffrances ne peuvent être décrites. Le
lendemain, ma respiration était oppressée. Aux douleurs de tête se
mêlaient d’étourdissants vertiges qui faisaient de moi un homme ivre. Mes
compagnons éprouvaient les mêmes symptômes. Quelques hommes de
l’équipage râlaient.
Ce jour−là, le sixième de notre emprisonnement, le capitaine Nemo,
trouvant trop lents la pioche et le pic, résolut d’écraser la couche de
glaces qui nous séparait encore de la nappe liquide. Cet homme avait
conservé son sang−froid et son énergie. Il domptait par sa force morale
les douleurs physiques. Il pensait, il combinait, il agissait.
D’après son ordre, le bâtiment fut soulagé, c’est−à−dire soulevé de la
couche glacée par un changement de pesanteur spécifique. Lorsqu’il flotta
on le hala de manière à l’amener au−dessus de l’immense fosse dessinée
suivant sa ligne de flottaison. Puis, ses réservoirs d’eau s’emplissant, il
descendit et s’embotta dans l’alvéole.
En ce moment, tout l’équipage rentra à bord, et la double porte de
communication fut fermée. Le Nautilus reposait alors sur la couche de
glace qui n’avait pas un mètre d’épaisseur et que les sondes avaient trouée
en mille endroits.
Les robinets des réservoirs furent alors ouverts en grand et cent mètres
cubes d’eau s’y précipitèrent, accroissant de cent mille kilogrammes le
poids du Nautilus.
Nous attendions, nous écoutions, oubliant nos souffrances, espérant
encore. Nous jouions notre salut sur un dernier coup.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 437
Malgré les bourdonnements qui emplissaient ma tête, j’entendis bientôt
des frémissements sous la coque du Nautilus. Un dénivellement se
produisit. La glace craqua avec un fracas singulier, pareil à celui du
papier qui se déchire, et le Nautilus s’abaissa.
« Nous passons ! » murmura Conseil a mon oreille.
Je ne pus lui répondre. Je saisis sa main. Je la pressai dans une convulsion
involontaire.
Tout à coup, emporté par son effroyable surcharge, le Nautilus s’enfonça
comme un boulet sous les eaux, c’est−à−dire qu’il tomba comme il eût fait
dans le vide !
Avec toute la force électrique fut mise sur les pompes qui aussitôt
commencèrent à chasser l’eau des réservoirs. Après quelques minutes,
notre chute fut enrayée. Bientôt même, le manomètre indiqua un
mouvement ascensionnel. L’hélice, marchant à toute vitesse, fit tressaillir
la coque de tôle jusque dans ses boulons, et nous entraîna vers le nord.
Mais que devait durer cette navigation sous la banquise jusqu’à la mer
libre ? Un jour encore ? Je serais mort avant !
A demi étendu sur un divan de la bibliothèque, je suffoquais. Ma face était
violette, mes lèvres bleues, mes facultés suspendues. Je ne voyais plus, je
n’entendais plus. La notion du temps avait disparu de mon esprit. Mes
muscles ne pouvaient se contracter.
Les heures qui s’écoulèrent ainsi, je ne saurais les évaluer. Mais j’eus la
conscience de mon agonie qui commençait. Je compris que j’allais
mourir...
Soudain je revins à moi. Quelques bouffées d’air pénétraient dans mes
poumons. Étions−nous remontés à la surface des flots ? Avions−nous
franchi la banquise ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 438
Non ! C’étaient Ned et Conseil, mes deux braves amis, qui se sacrifiaient
pour me sauver. Quelques atomes d’air restaient encore au fond d’un
appareil. Au lieu de le respirer, ils l’avaient consacré pour moi, et, tandis
qu’ils suffoquaient, ils me versaient la vie goutte à goutte ! Je voulus
repousser l’appareil. Ils me tinrent les mains, et pendant quelques instants,
je respirai avec volupté.
Mes regards se portèrent vers l’horloge. Il était onze heures du matin.
Nous devions être au 28 mars. Le Nautilus marchait avec une vitesse
effrayante de quarante milles à l’heure. Il se tordait dans les eaux.
Où était le capitaine Nemo ? Avait−il succombé ? Ses compagnons
étaient−ils morts avec lui ?
En ce moment, le manomètre indiqua que nous n’étions plus qu’à vingt
pieds de la surface. Un simple champ de glace nous séparait de
l’atmosphère. Ne pouvait−on le briser ?
Peut−être ! En tout cas, le Nautilus allait le tenter. Je sentis, en effet, qu’il
prenait une position oblique, abaissant son arrière et relevant son éperon.
Une introduction d’eau avait suffi pour rompre son équilibre. Puis, poussé
par sa puissante hélice, il attaqua l’ice−field par en dessous comme un
formidable bélier. Il le crevait peu à peu, se retirait, donnait à toute vitesse
contre le champ qui se déchirait, et enfin, emporté par un élan suprême, il
s’élança sur la surface glacée qu’il écrasa de son poids.
Le panneau fut ouvert, on pourrait dire arraché, et l’air pur
s’introduisit à flots dans toutes les parties du Nautilus.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Faute d'air 439
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone
Comment étais−je sur la plate−forme, je ne saurais le dire. Peut−être le
Canadien m’y avait−il transporté. Mais je respirais, je humais l’air
vivifiant de la mer. Mes deux compagnons s’enivraient près de moi de ces
fraîches molécules. Les malheureux. trop longtemps privés de nourriture,
ne peuvent se jeter inconsidérément sur les premiers aliments qu’on leur
présente. Nous. au contraire, nous n’avions pas à nous modérer, nous
pouvions aspirer à pleins poumons les atomes de cette atmosphère, et
c’était la brise, la brise elle−même qui nous versait cette voluptueuse
ivresse !
« Ah ! faisait Conseil, que c’est bon, l’oxygène ! Que monsieur ne craigne
pas de respirer. Il y en a pour tout le monde. »
Quant à Ned Land, il ne parlait pas, mais il ouvrait des mâchoires à
effrayer un requin. Et quelles puissantes aspirations ! Le Canadien « tirait
» comme un poêle en pleine combustion.
Les forces nous revinrent promptement, et, lorsque je regardai autour de
moi, je vis que nous étions seuls sur la plate−forme. Aucun homme de
l’équipage. Pas même le capitaine Nemo. Les étranges marins du Nautilus
se contentaient de l’air qui circulait à l’intérieur. Aucun n’était venu se
délecter en pleine atmosphère.
Les premières paroles que je prononçai furent des paroles de
remerciements et de gratitude pour mes deux compagnons. Ned et Conseil
avaient prolongé mon existence pendant les dernières heures de cette
longue agonie. Toute ma reconnaissance ne pouvait payer trop un tel
dévouement.
« Bon ! monsieur le professeur, me répondit Ned Land, cela ne vaut pas la
peine d’en parler ! Quel mérite avons−nous eu à cela ? Aucun. Ce n’était
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 440
qu’une question d’arithmétique. Votre existence valait plus que la nôtre.
Donc il fallait la conserver.
— Non, Ned, repondis−je, elle ne valait pas plus. Personne n’est supérieur
à un homme généreux et bon, et vous l’êtes !
— C’est bien ! c’est bien ! répétait le Canadien embarrassé
— Et toi, mon brave Conseil, tu as bien souffert.
— Mais pas trop, pour tout dire à monsieur. Il me manquait bien quelques
gorgées d’air, mais je crois que je m’y serais fait. D’ailleurs, je regardais
monsieur qui se pâmait et cela ne me donnait pas la moindre envie de
respirer. Cela me coupait, comme on dit, le respir... »
Conseil, confus de s’être jeté dans la banalité, n’acheva pas.
« Mes amis, répondis−je vivement ému, nous sommes liés les uns aux
autres pour jamais, et vous avez sur moi des droits...
— Dont j’abuserai, riposta le Canadien.
— Hein ? fit Conseil.
— Oui, reprit Ned Land, le droit de vous entraîner avec moi, quand je
quitterai cet infernal Nautilus.
— Au fait, dit Conseil, allons−nous du bon côté ?
— Oui, répondis−je, puisque nous allons du côté du soleil, et ici le soleil,
c’est le nord.
— Sans doute, reprit Ned Land, mais il reste à savoir si nous rallions le
Pacifique ou l’Atlantique, c’est−à−dire les mers fréquentées ou désertes. »
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 441
A cela je ne pouvais répondre, et je craignais que le capitaine Nemo ne
nous ramenât plutôt vers ce vaste Océan qui baigne à la fois les côtes de
l’Asie et de l’Amérique. Il compléterait ainsi son tour du monde
sous−marin, et reviendrait vers ces mers où le Nautilus trouvait la plus
entière indépendance. Mais si nous retournions au Pacifique, loin de toute
terre habitée, que devenaient les projets de Ned Land ?
Nous devions, avant peu, être fixés sur ce point important. Le Nautilus
marchait rapidement. Le cercle polaire fut bientôt franchi, et le cap mis
sur le promontoire de Horn. Nous étions par le travers de la pointe
américaine, le 31 mars, à sept heures du soir.
Alors toutes nos souffrances passées étaient oubliées. Le souvenir de cet
emprisonnement dans les glaces s’effaçait de notre esprit. Nous ne
songions qu’à l’avenir. Le capitaine Nemo ne paraissait plus, ni dans le
salon, ni sur la plate−forme. Le point reporté chaque jour sur le
planisphère et fait par le second me permettait de relever la direction
exacte du Nautilus. Or, ce soir−là, il devint évident, à ma grande
satisfaction, que nous revenions au nord par la route de l’Atlantique.
J’appris au Canadien et à Conseil le résultat de mes observations.
« Bonne nouvelle, répondit le Canadien, mais où va le Nautilus ?
— Je ne saurais le dire, Ned.
— Son capitaine voudrait−il, après le pôle sud, affronter le pôle nord, et
revenir au Pacifique par le fameux passage du nord−ouest ?
Il ne faudrait pas l’en défier, répondit Conseil.
— Eh bien, dit le Canadien, nous lui fausserons compagnie auparavant.
— En tout cas, ajouta Conseil, c’est un maître homme que ce
capitaine Nemo, et nous ne regretterons pas de l’avoir connu.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 442
— Surtout quand nous l’aurons quitté ! » riposta Ned Land.
Le lendemain, premier avril, lorsque le Nautilus remonta à la surface des
flots, quelques minutes avant midi, nous eûmes connaissance d’une côte à
l’ouest. C’était la Terre du Feu, à laquelle les premiers navigateurs
donnèrent ce nom en voyant les fumées nombreuses qui s’élevaient des
huttes indigènes. Cette Terre du Feu forme une vaste agglomération d’îles
qui s’étend sur trente lieues de long et quatre−vingts lieues de large, entre
53° et 56° de latitude australe, et 67°50’et 77°15’de longitude ouest. La
côte me parut basse, mais au loin se dressaient de hautes montagnes. Je
crus même entrevoir le mont Sarmiento, élevé de deux mille soixante−dix
mètres au−dessus du niveau de la mer, bloc pyramidal de schiste, à
sommet très aigu, qui, suivant qu’il est voilé ou dégagé de vapeurs, «
annonce le beau ou le mauvais temps », me dit Ned Land.
« Un fameux baromètre, mon ami.
— Oui, monsieur, un baromètre naturel, qui ne m’a jamais trompé quand
je naviguais dans les passes du détroit de Magellan. »
En ce moment, ce pic nous parut nettement découpé sur le fond du ciel.
C’était un présage de beau temps Il se réalisa.
Le Nautilus, rentré sous les eaux, se rapprocha de la côte qu’il prolongea
à quelques milles seulement. Par les vitres du salon, je vis de longues
lianes, et des fucus gigantesques, ces varechs porte−poires, dont la mer
libre du pôle renfermait quelques échantillons, avec leurs filaments
visqueux et polis, ils mesuraient jusqu’à trois cents mètres de longueur ;
véritables câbles, plus gros que le pouce, très résistants, ils servent
souvent d’amarres aux navires. Une autre herbe, connue sous le nom de
velp, à feuilles longues de quatre pieds, empâtées dans les concrétions
coralligènes, tapissait les fonds. Elle servait de nid et de nourriture à des
myriades de crustacés et de mollusques, des crabes, des seiches. Là, les
phoques et les loutres se livraient à de splendides repas, mélangeant la
chair du poisson et les légumes de la mer, suivant la méthode anglaise.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 443
Sur ces fonds gras et luxuriants, le Nautilus passait avec une extrême
rapidité. Vers le soir, il se rapprocha de l’archipel des Malouines, dont je
pus, le lendemain, reconnaître les âpres sommets. La profondeur de la mer
était médiocre. Je pensai donc, non sans raison, que ces deux îles,
entourées d’un grand nombre d’îlots, faisaient autrefois partie des terres
magellaniques. Les Malouines furent probablement découvertes par le
célèbre John Davis, qui leur imposa le nom de Davis−Southern Islands.
Plus tard, Richard Hawkins les appela Maiden−Islands, îles de la Vierge.
Elles furent ensuite nommées Malouines, au commencement du
dix−huitième siècle. par des pêcheurs de Saint−Malo, et enfin Falkland
par les Anglais auxquels elles appartiennent aujourd’hui.
Sur ces parages, nos filets rapportèrent de beaux spécimens d’algues, et
particulièrement un certain fucus dont les racines étaient chargées de
moules qui sont les meilleures du monde. Des oies et des canards
s’abattirent par douzaines sur la plate−forme et prirent place bientôt dans
les offices du bord. En fait de poissons, j’observai spécialement des osseux
appartenant au genre gobie, et surtout des boulerots, longs de deux
décimètres, tout parsemés de taches blanchâtres et jaunes.
J’admirai également de nombreuses méduses, et les plus belles du genre,
les chrysaores particulières aux mers des Malouines. Tantôt elles
figuraient une ombrelle demi−sphérique très lisse, rayée de lignes d’un
rouge brun et terminée par douze festons réguliers ; tantôt c’était une
corbeille renversée d’où s’échappaient gracieusement de larges feuilles et
de longues ramilles rouges. Elles nageaient en agitant leurs quatre bras
foliacés et laissaient pendre à la dérive leur opulente chevelure de
tentacules. J’aurais voulu conserver quelques échantillons de ces délicats
zoophytes ; mais ce ne sont que des nuages, des ombres, des apparences,
qui fondent et s’évaporent hors de leur élément natal.
Lorsque les dernières hauteurs des Malouines eurent disparu sous
l’horizon, le Nautilus s’immergea entre vingt et vingt−cinq mètres et suivit
la côte américaine. Le capitaine Nemo ne se montrait pas.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 444
Jusqu’au 3 avril, nous ne quittâmes pas les parages de la Patagonie, tantôt
sous l’Océan, tantôt à sa surface. Le Nautilus dépassa le large estuaire
formé par l’embouchure de la Plata, et se trouva, le 4 avril, par le travers
de l’Uruguay, mais à cinquante milles au large. Sa direction se maintenait
au nord, et il suivait les longues sinuosités de l’Amérique méridionale.
Nous avions fait alors seize mille lieues depuis notre embarquement dans
les mers du Japon.
Vers onze heures du matin, le tropique du Capricorne fut coupé sur le
trente−septième méridien, et nous passâmes au large du cap Frio. Le
capitaine Nemo, au grand déplaisir de Ned Land, n’aimait pas le
voisinage de ces côtes habitées du Brésil, car il marchait avec une vitesse
vertigineuse. Pas un poisson, pas un oiseau, des plus rapides qui soient, ne
pouvaient nous suivre, et les curiosités naturelles de ces mers échappèrent
à toute observation.
Cette rapidité se soutint pendant plusieurs jours, et le 9 avril, au soir, nous
avions connaissance de la pointe la plus orientale de l’Amérique du Sud
qui forme le cap San Roque. Mais alors le Nautilus s’écarta de nouveau, et
il alla chercher à de plus grandes profondeurs une vallée sous−marine qui
se creuse entre ce cap et Sierra Leone sur la côte africaine. Cette vallée se
bifurque à la hauteur des Antilles et se termine au nord par une énorme
dépression de neuf mille mètres. En cet endroit. La coupe géologique de
l’Océan figure jusqu’aux petites Antilles une falaise de six kilomètres,
taillée à pic. et, à la hauteur des îles du cap Vert, une autre muraille non
moins considérable, qui enferment ainsi tout le continent immergé de
l’Atlantide. Le fond de cette immense vallée est accidenté de quelques
montagnes qui ménagent de pittoresques aspects à ces fonds sous−marins.
J’en parle surtout d’après les cartes manuscrites que contenait la
bibliothèque du Nautilus, cartes évidemment dues à la main du capitaine
Nemo et levées sur ses observations personnelles.
Pendant deux jours, ces eaux désertes et profondes furent visitées au
moyen des plans inclinés. Le Nautilus fournissait de longues bordées
diagonales qui le portaient à toutes les hauteurs. Mais le 11 avril, il se
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 445
releva subitement, et la terre nous réapparut à l’ouvert du fleuve des
Amazones, vaste estuaire dont le débit est si considérable qu’il dessale la
mer sur un espace de plusieurs lieues.
L’Équateur était coupé. A vingt milles dans l’ouest restaient les Guyanes,
une terre française sur laquelle nous eussions trouvé un facile refuge.
Mais le vent soufflait en grande brise, et les lames furieuses n’auraient pas
permis à un simple canot de les affronter. Ned Land le comprit sans doute,
car il ne me parla de rien. De mon côté, je ne fis aucune allusion à ses
projets de fuite, car je ne voulais pas le pousser à quelque tentative qui eût
infailliblement avorté.
Je me dédommageai facilement de ce retard par d’intéressantes études.
Pendant ces deux journées des 11 et 12 avril, le Nautilus ne quitta pas la
surface de la mer, et son chalut lui ramena toute une pêche miraculeuse en
zoophytes, en poissons et en reptiles.
Quelques zoophytes avaient été dragues par la chaîne des chaluts.
C’étaient, pour la plupart, de belles phyctallines, appartenant à la famille
des actinidiens. et entre autres espèces, le phyctalis protexta, originaire de
cette partie de l’Océan, petit tronc cylindrique, agrémenté de lignes
verticales et tacheté de points rouges que couronne un merveilleux
épanouissement de tentacules. Quant aux mollusques, ils consistaient en
produits que j’avais déjà observés, des turritelles, des olives−porphyres à
lignes régulièrement entrecroisées dont les taches rousses se relevaient
vivement sur un fond de chair. des ptérocères fantaisistes, semblables à
des scorpions pétrifiés, des hyales translucides, des argonautes, des
seiches excellentes à manger, et certaines espèces de calmars, que les
naturalistes de l’antiquité classaient parmi les poissons−volants, et qui
servent principalement d’appât pour la pêche de la morue.
Des poissons de ces parages que je n’avais pas encore eu l’occasion
d’étudier, je notai diverses espèces. Parmi les cartilagineux : des
pétromizons−pricka, sortes d’anguilles, longues de quinze pouces, tête
verdâtre, nageoires violettes, dos gris bleuâtre, ventre brun argenté semé
de taches vives, iris des yeux cerclé d’or, curieux animaux que le courant
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 446
de l’Amazone avait dû entraîner jusqu’en mer, car ils habitent les eaux
douces ; des raies tuberculées, à museau pointu, à queue longue et déliée,
armées d’un long aiguillon dentelé ; de petits squales d’un mètre, gris et
blanchâtres de peau, dont les dents, disposées sur plusieurs rangs, se
recourbent en arrière. et qui sont vulgairement connus sous le nom de
pantouffliers ; des lophies−vespertillions, sortes de triangles isocèles
rougeâtres, d’un demi−mètre, auxquels les pectorales tiennent par des
prolongations charnues qui leur donnent l’aspect de chauves−souris, mais
que leur appendice corné, situé près des narines, a fait surnommer
licornes de mer ; enfin quelques espèces de batistes, le curassavien dont
les flancs pointillés brillent d’une éclatante couleur d’or, et le caprisque
violet clair, à nuances chatoyantes comme la gorge d’un pigeon.
Je termine là cette nomenclature un peu sèche, mais très exacte, par la
série des poissons osseux que j’observai : passans, appartenant au genre
des apléronotes dont le museau est très obtus et blanc de neige, le corps
peint d’un beau noir, et qui sont munis d’une lanière charnue très longue
et très déliée ; odontagnathes aiguillonnés, longues sardines de trois
décimètres, resplendissant d’un vif éclat argenté ; scombres−guares,
pourvus de deux nageoires anales ; centronotes−nègres, à teintes noires,
que l’on pêche avec des brandons, longs poissons de deux mètres, à chair
grasse, blanche, ferme, qui, frais, ont le goût de l’anguille, et secs, le goût
du saumon fumé ; labres demi−rouges, revêtus d’écailles seulement à la
base des nageoires dorsales et anales ; chrysoptères, sur lesquels l’or et
l’argent mêlent leur éclat à ceux du rubis et de la topaze ;
spares−queues−d’or, dont la chair est extrêmement délicate, et que leurs
propriétés phosphorescentes trahissent au milieu des eaux ; spares−pobs,
à langue fine, à teintes orange ; sciènes−coro à caudales d’or,
acanthures−noirauds, anableps de Surinam, etc.
Cet « et coetera » ne saurait empêcher de citer encore un poisson dont
Conseil se souviendra longtemps et pour cause.
Un de nos filets avait rapporté une sorte de raie très aplatie qui, la queue
coupée, eût formé un disque parfait et qui pesait une vingtaine de
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 447
kilogrammes. Elle était blanche en dessous, rougeâtre en dessus, avec de
grandes taches rondes d’un bleu foncé et cerclées de noir, très lisse de
peau, et terminée par une nageoire bilobée. Étendue sur la plate−forme,
elle se débattait, essayait de se retourner par des mouvements convulsifs,
et faisait tant d’efforts qu’un dernier soubresaut allait la précipiter à la
mer. Mais Conseil, qui tenait à son poisson, se précipita sur lui, et, avant
que je ne pusse l’en empêcher, il le saisit à deux mains.
Aussitôt, le voilà renversé, les jambes en l’air, paralysé d’une moitié du
corps, et criant :
« Ah ! mon maître, mon maître ! Venez à moi. »
C’était la première fois que le pauvre garçon ne me parlait pas « à la
troisième personne ».
Le Canadien et moi, nous l’avions relevé, nous le frictionnions à bras
raccourcis, et quand il reprit ses sens, cet éternel classificateur murmura
d’une voix entrecoupée :
« Classe des cartilagineux, ordre des chondroptérygiens, à branchies fixes,
sous−ordre des sélaciens, famille des raies, genre des torpilles ! »
— Oui, mon ami, répondis−je, c’est une torpille qui t’a mis dans ce
déplorable état.
— Ah ! monsieur peut m’en croire, riposta Conseil, mais je me vengerai de
cet animal.
Et comment ?
— En le mangeant. »
Ce qu’il fit le soir même, mais par pure représaille, car franchement
c’était coriace.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 448
L’infortuné Conseil s’était attaqué à une torpille de la plus dangereuse
espèce, la cumana. Ce bizarre animal, dans un milieu conducteur tel que
l’eau, foudroie les poissons à plusieurs mètres de distance, tant est grande
la puissance de son organe électrique dont les deux surfaces principales
ne mesurent pas moins de vingt−sept pieds carrés.
Le lendemain, 12 avril, pendant la journée, le Nautilus s’approcha de la
côte hollandaise, vers l’embouchure du Maroni. Là vivaient en famille
plusieurs groupes de lamantins. C’étaient des manates qui, comme le
dugong et le stellère, appartiennent à l’ordre des syréniens. Ces beaux
animaux, paisibles et inoffensifs, longs de six à sept mètres, devaient peser
au moins quatre mille kilogrammes. J’appris à Ned Land et à Conseil que
la prévoyante nature avait assigné à ces mammifères un tôle important. Ce
sont eux, en effet, qui, comme les phoques, doivent paître les prairies
sous−marines et détruire ainsi les agglomérations d’herbes qui obstruent
l’embouchure des fleuves tropicaux.
« Et savez−vous, ajoutai−je, ce qui s’est produit, depuis que les hommes
ont presque entièrement anéanti, ces races utiles ? C’est que les herbes
putréfiées ont empoisonné l’air, et l’air empoisonné, c’est la fièvre jaune
qui désole ces admirables contrées. Les végétations vénéneuses se sont
multipliées sous ces mers torrides, et le mal s’est irrésistiblement
développé depuis l’embouchure du Rio de la Plata jusqu’aux Florides ! »
Et s’il faut en croire Toussenel, ce fléau n’est rien encore auprès de celui
qui frappera nos descendants, lorsque les mers seront dépeuplées de
baleines et de phoques. Alors, encombrées de poulpes, de méduses, de
calmars, elles deviendront de vastes foyers d’infection, puisque leurs flots
ne posséderont plus « ces vastes estomacs, que Dieu avait chargés
d’écumer la surface des mers ».
Cependant, sans dédaigner ces théories, l’équipage du Nautilus s’empara
d’une demi−douzaine de manates. Il s’agissait, en effet, d’approvisionner
les cambuses d’une chair excellente, supérieure à celle du boeuf et du
veau. Cette chasse ne fut pas intéressante. Les manates se laissaient
frapper sans se défendre. Plusieurs milliers de kilos de viande, destinée à
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 449
être séchée, furent emmagasinés à bord.
Ce jour−là, une pêche, singulièrement pratiquée, vint encore accroître les
réserves du Nautilus, tant ces mers se montraient giboyeuses. Le chalut
avait rapporté dans ses mailles un certain nombre de poissons dont la tête
se terminait par une plaque ovale à rebords charnus. C’étaient des
échénéïdes, de la troisième famille des malacoptérygiens subbrachiens.
Leur disque aplati se compose de lames cartilagineuses transversales
mobiles, entre lesquelles l’animal peut opérer le vide, ce qui lui permet
d’adhérer aux objets à la façon d’une ventouse.
Le rémora, que j’avais observé dans la Méditerranée, appartient à cette
espèce. Mais celui dont il s’agit ici. c’était l’échénélde ostéochère,
particulier à cette mer. Nos marins, a mesure qu’ils les prenaient, les
déposaient dans des bailles pleines d’eau.
La pêche terminée, le Nautilus se rapprocha de la côte. En cet endroit, un
certain nombre de tortues marines dormaient à la surface des flots. Il eût
été difficile de s’emparer de ces précieux reptiles, car le moindre bruit les
éveille, et leur solide carapace est à l’épreuve du harpon. Mais
l’échénéïde devait opérer cette capture avec une sûreté et une précision
extraordinaires. Cet animal, en effet, est un hameçon vivant, qui ferait le
bonheur et la fortune du naïf pêcheur a la ligne.
Les hommes du Naulilus attachèrent à la queue de ces poissons un anneau
assez large pour ne pas gêner leurs mouvements, et à cet anneau, une
longue corde amarrée à bord par l’autre bout.
Les échénéïdes, jetés à la mer, commencèrent aussitôt leur rôle et allèrent
se fixer au plastron des tortues. Leur ténacité était telle qu’ils se fussent
déchirés plutôt que de lâcher prise. On les halait à bord, et avec eux les
tortues auxquelles ils adhéraient.
On prit ainsi plusieurs cacouannes, larges d’un mètre, qui pesaient deux
cents kilos. Leur carapace, couverte de plaques cornées grandes, minces,
transparentes, brunes, avec mouchetures blanches et jaunes, les rendaient
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 450
très précieuses. En outre, elles étaient excellentes au point de vue
comestible, ainsi que les tortues franches qui sont d’un goût exquis.
Cette pêche termina notre séjour sur les parages de l’Amazone, et, la nuit
venue, le Nautilus regagna la haute mer.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Du cap Horn à l'Amazone 451
Les poulpes
Pendant quelques jours, le Nautilus s’écarta constamment de la côte
américaine. Il ne voulait pas, évidemment, fréquenter les flots du golfe du
Mexique ou de la mer des Antilles. Cependant, l’eau n’eût pas manqué
sous sa quille, puisque la profondeur moyenne de ces mers est de dix−huit
cents mètres ; mais, probablement ces parages, semés d’îles et sillonnés de
steamers, ne convenaient pas au capitaine Nemo.
Le 16 avril, nous eûmes connaissance de la Martinique et de la
Guadeloupe, à une distance de trente milles environ. J’aperçus un instant
leurs pitons élevés.
Le Canadien, qui comptait mettre ses projets à exécution dans le golfe, soit
en gagnant une terre, soit en accostant un des nombreux bateaux qui font
le cabotage d’une île à l’autre, fut très décontenancé. La fuite eût été très
praticable si Ned Land fût parvenu a s’emparer du canot à l’insu du
capitaine. Mais en plein Océan, il ne fallait plus y songer.
La Canadien, Conseil et moi, nous eûmes une assez longue conversation à
ce sujet. Depuis six mois nous étions prisonniers à bord du Nautilus. Nous
avions fait dix−sept mille lieues, et, comme le disait Ned Land, il n’y avait
pas de raison pour que cela finît. Il me fit donc une proposition à laquelle
je ne m’attendais pas. Ce fut de poser catégoriquement cette question au
capitaine Nemo : Le capitaine comptait−il nous garder indéfiniment à son
bord ?
Une semblable démarche me répugnait. Suivant moi, elle ne pouvait
aboutir. Il ne fallait rien espérer du commandant du Nautilus, mais tout de
nous seuls. D’ailleurs, depuis quelque temps, cet homme devenait plus
sombre, plus retiré, moins sociable. Il paraissait m’éviter. Je ne le
rencontrais qu’à de rares intervalles. Autrefois, il se plaisait à m’expliquer
les merveilles sous−marines ; maintenant il m’abandonnait à mes études
Les poulpes 452
et ne venait plus au salon.
Quel changement s’était opéré en lui ? Pour quelle cause ? Je n’avais rien
à me reprocher. Peut−être notre présence à bord lui pesait−elle ?
Cependant, je ne devais pas espérer qu’il fût homme à nous rendre la
liberté.
Je priai donc Ned de me laisser réfléchir avant d’agir. Si cette démarche
n’obtenait aucun résultat, elle pouvait raviver ses soupçons, rendre notre
situation pénible et nuire aux projets du Canadien. J’ajouterai que je ne
pouvais en aucune façon arguer de notre santé. Si l’on excepte la rude
épreuve de la banquise du pôle sud, nous ne nous étions jamais mieux
portés, ni Ned, ni Conseil, ni moi. Cette nourriture saine, cette atmosphère
salubre, cette régularité d’existence, cette uniformité de température, ne
donnaient pas prise aux maladies, et pour un homme auquel les souvenirs
de la terre ne laissaient aucun regret, pour un capitaine Nemo, qui est
chez lui, qui va où il veut, qui par des voies mystérieuses pour les autres,
non pour lui−même, marche à son but, je comprenais une telle existence.
Mais nous, nous n’avions pas rompu avec l’humanité. Pour mon compte,
je ne voulais pas ensevelir avec moi mes études si curieuses et si nouvelles.
J’avais maintenant le droit d’écrire le vrai livre de la mer, et ce livre, je
voulais que, plus tôt que plus tard, il pût voir le jour.
Là encore, dans ces eaux des Antilles, à dix mètres au−dessous de la
surface des flots, par les panneaux ouverts, que de produits intéressants
j’eus à signaler sur mes notes quotidiennes ! C’étaient, entre autres
zoophytes, des galères connues sous le nom de physalie spélagiques, sortes
de grosses vessies oblongues, à reflets nacrés, tendant leur membrane au
vent et laissant flotter leurs tentacules bleues comme des fils de soie ;
charmantes méduses à l’oeil, véritables orties au toucher qui distillent un
liquide corrosif. C’étaient, parmi les articulés, des annélides longs d’un
mètre et demi, armés d’une trompe rose et pourvus de dix−sept cents
organes locomoteurs, qui serpentaient sous les eaux et jetaient en passant
toutes les lueurs du spectre solaire. C’étaient, dans l’embranchement des
poissons, des raies−molubars, énormes cartilagineux longs de dix pieds et
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 453
pesant six cents livres, la nageoire pectorale triangulaire, le milieu du dos
un peu bombé, les yeux fixés aux extrémités de la face antérieure de la tête,
et qui, flottant comme
une épave de navire, s’appliquaient parfois comme un opaque volet sur
notre vitre. C’étaient des balistes américains pour lesquels la nature n’a
broyé que du blanc et du noir, des bobies plumiers, allongés et charnus,
aux nageoires jaunes, à la mâchoire proéminente, des scombres de seize
décimètres, à dents courtes et aiguës, couverts de petites écailles,
appartenant à l’espèce des albicores. Puis, par nuées, apparaissent des
surmulets, corsetés de raies d’or de la tête à la queue, agitant leurs
resplendissantes nageoires ; véritables chefs−d’oeuvre de bijouterie
consacrés autrefois à Diane, particulièrement recherchés des riches
Romains, et dont le proverbe disait : « Ne les mange pas qui les prend ! »
Enfin, des pomacanthes−dorés, ornés de bandelettes émeraude, habillés
de velours et de soie, passaient devant nos yeux comme des seigneurs de
Véronèse ; des spareséperonnés se dérobaient sous leur rapide nageoire
thoracine ; des clupanodons de quinze pouces s’enveloppaient de leurs
lueurs phosphorescentes ; des muges battaient la mer de leur grosse queue
charnue ; des corégones rouges semblaient faucher les flots avec leur
pectorale tranchante, et des sélènes argentées, dignes de leur nom, se
levaient sur l’horizon des eaux comme autant de lunes aux reflets
blanchâtres.
Que d’autres échantillons merveilleux et nouveaux j’eusse encore
observés, si le Nautilus ne se fût peu à peu abaissé vers les couches
profondes ! Ses plans inclinés l’entraînèrent jusqu’à des fonds de deux
mille et trois mille cinq cents mètres. Alors la vie animale n’était plus
représentée que par des encrines, des étoiles de mer, de charmantes
pentacrines tête de méduse, dont la tige droite supportait un petit calice,
des troques, des quenottes sanglantes et des fissurelles, mollusques
littoraux de grande espèce.
Le 20 avril, nous étions remontés à une hauteur moyenne de quinze cents
mètres. La terre la plus rapprochée était alors cet archipel des îles
Lucayes, disséminées comme un tas de pavés a la surface des eaux. Là
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 454
s’élevaient de hautes falaises sous−marines, murailles droites faites de
blocs frustes disposés par larges assises, entre lesquels se creusaient des
trous noirs que nos rayons électriques n’éclairaient pas jusqu’au fond.
Ces roches étaient tapissés de grandes herbes, de laminaires géants, de
fucus gigantesques, un véritable espalier d’hydrophytes digne d’un monde
de Titans.
De ces plantes colossales dont nous parlions, Conseil, Ned et moi, nous
fûmes naturellement amenés à citer les animaux gigantesques de la mer.
Les unes sont évidemment destinées à la nourriture des autres. Cependant,
par les vitres du Nautilus presque immobile, je n’apercevais encore sur ces
longs filaments que les principaux articulés de la division des brachioures,
des l’ambres à longues pattes, des crabes violacés, des clios particuliers
aux mers des Antilles.
Il était environ onze heures, quand Ned Land attira mon attention sur un
formidable fourmillement qui se produisait à travers les grandes algues.
« Eh bien, dis−je, ce sont là de véritables cavernes à poulpes, et je ne
serais pas étonné d’y voir quelques−uns de ces monstres.
— Quoi ! fit Conseil, des calmars, de simples calmars, de la classe des
céphalopodes ?
— Non, dis−je, des poulpes de grande dimension. Mais l’ami Land s’est
trompé, sans doute, car je n’aperçois rien.
— Je le regrette répliqua Conseil. Je voudrais contempler face à face l’un
de ces poulpes dont j’ai tant entendu parler et qui peuvent entraîner des
navires dans le fond des abîmes. Ces bêtes−là, ça se nomme des krak...
— Craque suffit, répondit ironiquement le Canadien.
— Krakens, riposta Conseil, achevant son mot sans se soucier de la
plaisanterie de son compagnon.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 455
— Jamais on ne me fera croire, dit Ned Land, que de tels animaux existent.
— Pourquoi pas ? répondit Conseil. Nous avons bien cru au narval de
monsieur.
— Nous avons eu tort, Conseil.
— Sans doute ! mais d’autres y croient sans doute encore.
— C’est probable, Conseil, mais pour mon compte, je suis bien décidé à
n’admettre l’existence de ces monstres que lorsque je les aurai disséqués
de ma propre main.
— Ainsi, me demanda Conseil, monsieur ne croit pas aux poulpes
gigantesques ?
— Eh ! qui diable y a jamais cru ? s’écria le Canadien.
— Beaucoup de gens, ami Ned.
— Pas des pêcheurs. Des savants, peut−être !
— Pardon, Ned. Des pêcheurs et des savants !
— Mais moi qui vous parle, dit Conseil de l’air le plus sérieux du monde,
je me rappelle parfaitement avoir vu une grande embarcation entraînée
sous les flots par les bras d’un céphalopode.
— Vous avez vu cela ? demanda le Canadien.
— Oui, Ned.
— De vos propres yeux ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 456
— De mes propres yeux.
— Où, s’il vous plaît ?
— A Saint−Malo ? repartit imperturbablement Conseil.
— Dans le port ? dit Ned Land ironiquement.
— Non, dans une église, répondit Conseil.
— Dans une église ! s’écria le Canadien.
— Oui, ami Ned. C’était un tableau qui représentait le poulpe en
question !
— Bon ! fit Ned Land, éclatant de rire. Monsieur Conseil qui me fait
poser !
— Au fait, il a raison, dis−je. J’ai entendu parler de ce tableau ; mais le
sujet qu’il représente est tiré d’une légende, et vous savez ce qu’il faut
penser des légendes en matière d’histoire naturelle ! D’ailleurs, quand il
s’agit de monstres, l’imagination ne demande qu’à s’égarer.
Non seulement on a prétendu que ces poulpes pouvaient entraîner des
navires, mais un certain Olaus Magnus parle d’un céphalopode, long d’un
mille, qui ressemblait plutôt à une île qu’à un animal. On raconte aussi
que l’évêque de Nidros dressa un jour un autel sur un rocher immense. Sa
messe finie, le rocher se mit en marche et retourna à la mer. Le rocher
était un poulpe.
— Et c’est tout ? demanda le Canadien.
— Non, répondis−je. Un autre évêque, Pontoppidan de Berghem, parle
également d’un poulpe sur lequel pouvait manoeuvrer un régiment de
cavalerie !
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 457
— Ils allaient bien, les évêques d’autrefois ! dit Ned Land.
— Enfin, les naturalistes de l’antiquité citent des monstres dont la gueule
ressemblait à un golfe, et qui étaient trop gros pour passer par le détroit
de Gibraltar.
— A la bonne heure ! fit le Canadien.
— Mais dans tous ces récits, qu’y a−t−il de vrai ? demanda Conseil.
— Rien, mes amis, rien du moins de ce qui passe la limite de la
vraisemblance pour monter jusqu’à la fable ou à la légende. Toutefois, à
l’imagination des conteurs, il faut sinon une cause, du moins un prétexte.
On ne peut nier qu’il existe des poulpes et des calmars de très grande
espèce, mais inférieurs cependant aux cétacés. Aristote a constaté les
dimensions d’un calmar de cinq coudées, soit trois mètres dix. Nos
pêcheurs en voient fréquemment dont la longueur dépasse un mètre
quatre−vingts. Les musées de Trieste et de Montpellier conservent des
squelettes de poulpes qui mesurent deux mètres. D’ailleurs, suivant le
calcul des naturalistes, un de ces animaux, long de six pieds seulement,
aurait des tentacules longs de vingt−sept. Ce qui suffit pour en faire un
monstre formidable.
— En pêche−t−on de nos jours ? demanda le Canadien.
— S’ils n’en pêchent pas, les marins en voient du moins. Un de mes amis,
le capitaine Paul Bos, du Havre, m’a souvent affirmé qu’il avait rencontré
un de ces monstres de taille colossale dans les mers de l’Inde. Mais le fait
le plus étonnant et qui ne permet plus de nier l’existence de ces animaux
gigantesques, s’est passé il y a quelques années, en 1861.
— Quel est ce fait ? demanda Ned Land.
— Le voici. En 1861, dans le nord−est de Ténériffe, à peu près par la
latitude où nous sommes en ce moment, l’équipage de l’aviso l’Alecton
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 458
aperçut un monstrueux calmar qui nageait dans ses eaux. Le commandant
Bouguer s’approcha de l’animal, et il l’attaqua à coups de harpon et à
coups de fusil, sans grand succès, car balles et harpons traversaient ces
chairs molles comme une gelée sans consistance. Après plusieurs
tentatives infructueuses, l’équipage parvint à passer un noeud coulant
autour du corps du mollusque. Ce noeud glissa jusqu’aux nageoires
caudales et s’y arrêta. On essaya alors de haler le monstre à bord, mais
son poids était si considérable qu’il se sépara de sa queue sous la traction
de la corde, et, privé de cet ornement, il disparut sous les eaux.
— Enfin, voilà un fait, dit Ned Land.
— Un fait indiscutable, mon brave Ned. Aussi a−t−on proposé de nommer
ce poulpe « calmar de Bouguer ».
— Et quelle était sa longueur ? demanda le Canadien.
— Ne mesurait−il pas six mètres environ ? dit Conseil, qui posté à la vitre,
examinait de nouveau les anfractuosités de la falaise.
— Précisément, répondis−je.
— Sa tête, reprit Conseil, n’était−elle pas couronnée de huit tentacules,
qui s’agitaient sur l’eau comme une nichée de serpents ?
— Précisément.
— Ses yeux, placés à fleur de tête, n’avaient−ils pas un développement
considérable ?
— Oui, Conseil.
— Et sa bouche, n’était−ce pas un véritable bec de perroquet, mais un bec
formidable ?
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 459
— En effet, Conseil.
— Eh bien ! n’en déplaise à monsieur, répondit tranquillement Conseil, si
ce n’est pas le calmar de Bouguer, voici, du moins, un de ses frères. »
Je regardai Conseil. Ned Land se précipita vers la vitre.
« L’épouvantable bête », s’écria−t−il.
Je regardai à mon tour, et je ne pus réprimer un mouvement de répulsion.
Devant mes yeux s’agitait un monstre horrible, digne de figurer dans les
légendes tératologiques.
C’était un calmar de dimensions colossales, ayant huit mètres de longueur.
Il marchait à reculons avec une extrême vélocité dans la direction du
Nautilus. Il regardait de ses énormes yeux fixes à teintes glauques. Ses huit
bras, ou plutôt ses huit pieds, implantés sur sa tête, qui ont valu à ces
animaux le nom de céphalopodes, avaient un développement double de son
corps et se tordaient comme la chevelure des furies. On voyait
distinctement les deux cent cinquante ventouses disposées sur la face
interne des tentacules sous forme de capsules semisphériques. Parfois ces
ventouses s’appliquaient sur la vitre du salon en y faisant le vide. La
bouche de ce monstre — un bec de corne fait comme le bec d’un perroquet
— s’ouvrait et se refermait verticalement. Sa langue, substance cornée,
armée elle−même de plusieurs rangées de dents aiguës, sortait en
frémissant de cette véritable cisaille. Quelle fantaisie de la nature ! Un bec
d’oiseau à un mollusque ! Son corps, fusiforme et renflé dans sa partie
moyenne, formait une masse charnue qui devait peser vingt à vingt−cinq
mille kilogrammes. Sa couleur inconstante, changeant avec une extrême
rapidité suivant l’irritation de l’animal, passait successivement du gris
livide au brun rougeâtre.
De quoi s’irritait ce mollusque ? Sans doute de la présence de ce Nautilus,
plus formidable que lui, et sur lequel ses bras suceurs ou ses mandibules
n’avaient aucune prise. Et cependant, quels monstres que ces poulpes,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 460
quelle vitalité le créateur leur a départie, quelle vigueur dans leurs
mouvements, puisqu’ils possèdent trois coeurs !
Le hasard nous avait mis en présence de ce calmar, et je ne voulus pas
laisser perdre l’occasion d’étudier soigneusement cet échantillon des
céphalopodes. Je surmontai l’horreur que m’inspirait cet aspect, et,
prenant un crayon, Je commençai à le dessiner.
« C’est peut−être le même que celui de l’Alecton, dit Conseil.
— Non, répondit le Canadien, puisque celui−ci est entier et que l’autre a
perdu sa queue !
— Ce n’est pas une raison, répondis−je. Les bras et la queue de ces
animaux se reforment par rédintégration, et depuis sept ans, la queue du
calmar de Bouguer a sans doute eu le temps de repousser.
— D’ailleurs, riposta Ned, si ce n’est pas celui−ci, c’est peut−être un de
ceux−là ! »
En effet, d’autres poulpes apparaissaient a la vitre de tribord. J’en
comptai sept. Ils faisaient cortège au Nautilus, et j’entendis les
grincements de leur bec sur la coque de tôle. Nous étions servis à souhait.
Je continuai mon travail. Ces monstres se maintenaient dans nos eaux
avec une telle précision qu’ils semblaient immobiles, et j’aurais pu les
décalquer en raccourci sur la vitre. D’ailleurs, nous marchions sous une
allure modérée.
Tout à coup le Nautilus s’arrêta. Un choc le fit tressaillir dans toute sa
membrure.
« Est−ce que nous avons touché ? demandai−je.
— En tout cas, répondit le Canadien, nous serions déjà dégagés, car nous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 461
flottons. »
Le Nautilus flottait sans doute, mais il ne marchait plus. Les branches de
son hélice ne battaient pas les flots. Une minute se passa. Le capitaine
Nemo, suivi de son second, entra dans le salon.
Je ne l’avais pas vu depuis quelque temps. Il me parut sombre. Sans nous
parler, sans nous voir peut−être, il alla au panneau, regarda les poulpes
et dit quelques mots à son second.
Celui−ci sortit. Bientôt les panneaux se refermèrent. Le plafond
s’illumina.
J’allai vers le capitaine.
« Une curieuse collection de poulpes, lui dis−je, du ton dégagé que
prendrait un amateur devant le cristal d’un aquarium.
— En effet, monsieur le naturaliste, me répondit−il, et nous allons les
combattre corps à corps. »
Je regardai le capitaine. Je croyais n’avoir pas bien entendu.
« Corps à corps ? répétai−je.
— Oui, monsieur. L’hélice est arrêtée. Je pense que les mandibules
cornées de l’un de ces calmars se sont engagées dans ses branches. Ce qui
nous empêche de marcher.
— Et qu’allez−vous faire ?
— Remonter à la surface et massacrer toute cette vermine.
— Entreprise difficile.
— En effet. Les balles électriques sont impuissantes contre ces chairs
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 462
molles où elles ne trouvent pas assez de résistance pour éclater. Mais nous
les attaquerons à la hache.
— Et au harpon, monsieur, dit le Canadien, si vous ne refusez pas mon
aide.
— Je l’accepte, maître Land.
— Nous vous accompagnerons », dis−je, et, suivant le capitaine Nemo,
nous nous dirigeâmes vers l’escalier central.
Là, une dizaine d’hommes, armés de haches d’abordage, se tenaient prêts
à l’attaque. Conseil et moi, nous prîmes deux haches. Ned Land saisit un
harpon.
Le Nautilus était alors revenu à la surface des flots. Un des marins, placé
sur les derniers échelons, dévissait les boulons du panneau. Mais les
écrous étaient à peine dégagés, que le panneau se releva avec une violence
extrême, évidemment tiré par la ventouse d’un bras de poulpe.
Aussitôt un de ces longs bras se glissa comme un serpent par l’ouverture,
et vingt autres s’agitèrent au−dessus. D’un coup de hache, le capitaine
Nemo coupa ce formidable tentacule, qui glissa sur les échelons en se
tordant.
Au moment où nous nous pressions les uns sur les autres pour atteindre la
plate−forme, deux autres bras, cinglant l’air, s’abattirent sur le marin
placé devant le capitaine Nemo et l’enlevèrent avec une violence
irrésistible.
Le capitaine Nemo poussa un cri et s’élança au−dehors. Nous nous étions
précipités à sa suite.
Quelle scène ! Le malheureux, saisi par le tentacule et collé à ses
ventouses, était balancé dans l’air au caprice de cette énorme trompe. Il
râlait, il étouffait, il criait : A moi ! à moi ! Ces mots, prononcés en
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 463
français, me causèrent une profonde stupeur ! J’avais donc un compatriote
à bord, plusieurs, peut−être ! Cet appel déchirant, je l’entendrai toute ma
vie !
L’infortuné était perdu. Qui pouvait l’arracher à cette puissante étreinte ?
Cependant le capitaine Nemo s’était précipité sur le poulpe, et, d’un coup
de hache, il lui avait encore abattu un bras. Son second luttait avec rage
contre d’autres monstres qui rampaient sur les flancs du Nautilus.
L’équipage se battait à coups de hache. Le Canadien, Conseil et moi, nous
enfoncions nos armes dans ces masses charnues. Une violente odeur de
musc pénétrait l’atmosphère. C’était horrible.
Un instant, je crus que le malheureux, enlacé par le poulpe, serait arraché
à sa puissante succion. Sept bras sur huit avaient été coupés. Un seul,
brandissant la victime comme une plume, se tordait dans l’air. Mais au
moment où le capitaine Nemo et son second se précipitaient sur lui,
l’animal lança une colonne d’un liquide noirâtre, sécrété par une bourse
située dans son abdomen. Nous en fûmes aveuglés. Quand ce nuage se fut
dissipé, le calmar avait disparu, et avec lui mon infortuné compatriote !
Quelle rage nous poussa alors contre ces monstres ! On ne se possédait
plus. Dix ou douze poulpes avaient envahi la plate−forme et les flancs du
Nautilus. Nous roulions pêle−mêle au milieu de ces tronçons de serpents
qui tressautaient sur la plate−forme dans des flots de sang et d’encre
noire. Il semblait que ces visqueux tentacules renaissaient comme les têtes
de l’hydre. Le harpon de Ned Land, à chaque coup, se plongeait dans les
yeux glauques des calmars et les crevait. Mais mon audacieux compagnon
fut soudain renversé par les tentacules d’un monstre qu’il n’avait pu
éviter.
Ah ! comment mon coeur ne s’est−il pas brisé d’émotion et d’horreur ! Le
formidable bec du calmar s’était ouvert sur Ned Land. Ce malheureux
allait être coupé en deux. Je me précipitai à son secours. Mais le capitaine
Nemo m’avait devancé. Sa hache disparut entre les deux énormes
mandibules, et miraculeusement sauvé, le Canadien, se relevant, plongea
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 464
son harpon tout entier jusqu’au triple coeur du poulpe.
« Je me devais cette revanche ! » dit le capitaine Nemo au Canadien.
Ned s’inclina sans lui répondre.
Ce combat avait duré un quart d’heure. Les monstres vaincus, mutilés,
frappés à mort, nous laissèrent enfin la place et disparurent sous les flots.
Le capitaine Nemo, rouge de sang, immobile près du fanal, regardait la
mer qui avait englouti l’un de ses compagnons, et de grosses larmes
coulaient de ses yeux.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les poulpes 465
Le gulf−stream
Cette terrible scène du 20 avril, aucun de nous ne pourra jamais l’oublier.
Je l’ai écrite sous l’impression d’une émotion violente. Depuis, j’en ai
revu le récit. Je l’ai lu à Conseil et au Canadien. Ils l’ont trouvé exact
comme fait, mais insuffisant comme effet. Pour peindre de pareils
tableaux, il faudrait la plume du plus illustre de nos poètes, l’auteur des
Travailleurs de la Mer. J’ai dit que le capitaine Nemo pleurait en
regardant les flots.
Sa douleur fut immense. C’était le second compagnon qu’il perdait depuis
notre arrivée à bord. Et quelle mort ! Cet ami, écrasé, étouffé, brisé par le
formidable bras d’un poulpe, broyé sous ses mandibules de fer, ne devait
pas reposer avec ses compagnons dans les paisibles eaux du cimetière de
corail !
Pour moi, au milieu de cette lutte, c’était ce cri de désespoir poussé par
l’infortuné qui m’avait déchiré le coeur. Ce pauvre Français, oubliant son
langage de convention, s’était repris à parler la langue de son pays et de
sa mère, pour jeter un suprême appel ! Parmi cet équipage du Nautilus,
associé de corps et d’âme au capitaine Nemo, fuyant comme lui le contact
des hommes. j’avais donc un compatriote ! Était−il seul à représenter la
France dans cette mystérieuse association, évidemment composée
d’individus de nationalités diverses ? C’était encore un de ces insolubles
problèmes qui se dressaient sans cesse devant mon esprit !
Le capitaine Nemo rentra dans sa chambre, et je ne le vis plus pendant
quelque temps. Mais qu’il devait être triste, désespéré, irrésolu, si j’en
jugeais par ce navire dont il était l’âme et qui recevait toutes ses
impressions ! Le Nautilus ne gardait plus de direction déterminée. Il allait,
venait, flottait comme un cadavre au gré des lames. Son hélice avait été
dégagée, et cependant, il s’en servait à peine. Il naviguait au hasard. Il ne
pouvait s’arracher du théâtre de sa dernière lutte, de cette mer qui avait
Le gulf−stream 466
dévoré l’un des siens !
Dix jours se passèrent ainsi. Ce fut le 1er mai seulement que le Nautilus
reprit franchement sa route au nord, après avoir eu connaissance des
Lucayes à l’ouvert du canal de Bahama. Nous suivions alors le courant du
plus grand fleuve de la mer, qui a ses rives, ses poissons et sa température
propres. J’ai nommé le Gulf−Stream.
C’est un fleuve, en effet, qui coule librement au milieu de l’Atlantique, et
dont les eaux ne se mélangent pas aux eaux océaniennes. C’est un fleuve
salé, plus salé que la mer ambiante. Sa profondeur moyenne est de trois
mille pieds, sa largeur moyenne de soixante milles. En de certains
endroits, son courant marche avec une vitesse de quatre kilomètres à
l’heure. L’invariable volume de ses eaux est plus considérable que celui de
tous les fleuves du globe.
La véritable source du Gulf−Stream, reconnue par le commandant Maury,
son point de départ, si l’on veut. est situé dans le golfe de Gascogne. Là,
ses eaux, encore faibles de température et de couleur. commencent à se
former. Il descend au sud, longe l’Afrique équatoriale, échauffe ses flots
aux rayons de la zone torride, traverse l’Atlantique. atteint le cap
San−Roque sur la côte brésilienne, et se bifurque en deux branches dont
l’une va se saturer encore des chaudes molécules de la mer des Antilles.
Alors, le Gulf−Stream, chargé de rétablir l’équilibre entre les
températures et de mêler les eaux des tropiques aux eaux boréales,
commence son rôle de pondérateur. Chauffé à blanc dans le golfe du
Mexique, il s’élève au nord sur les côtes américaines, s’avance jusqu’à
Terre−Neuve, dévie sous la poussée du courant froid du détroit de Davis,
reprend la route de l’Océan en suivant sur un des grands cercles du globe
la ligne loxodromique, se divise en deux bras vers le quarante−troisième
degré, dont l’un, aidé par l’alizé du nord−est, revient au Golfe de
Gascogne et aux Açores, et dont l’autre, après avoir attiédi les rivages de
l’Irlande et de la Norvège, va jusqu’au−delà du Spitzberg, où sa
température tombe à quatre degrés, former la mer libre du pôle.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 467
C’est sur ce fleuve de l’Océan que le Nautilus naviguait alors. A sa sortie
du canal de Bahama, sur quatorze lieues de large, et sur trois cent
cinquante mètres de profondeur, le Gulf−Stream marche à raison de huit
kilomètres à l’heure. Cette rapidité décroît régulièrement à mesure qu’il
s’avance vers le nord, et il faut souhaiter que cette régularité persiste, car,
si, comme on a cru le remarquer, sa vitesse et sa direction viennent à se
modifier, les climats européens seront soumis à des perturbations dont on
ne saurait calculer les conséquences.
Vers midi, j’étais sur la plate−forme avec Conseil. Je lui faisais connaître
les particularités relatives au Gulf−Stream. Quand mon explication fut
terminée, je l’invitai a plonger ses mains dans le courant.
Conseil obéit, et fut très étonné de n’éprouver aucune sensation de chaud
ni de froid.
« Cela vient, lui dis−je, de ce que la température des eaux du
Gulf−Stream, en sortant du golfe du Mexique. est peu différente de celle
du sang. Ce Gulf−Stream est un vaste calorifère qui permet aux côtes
d’Europe de se parer d’une éternelle verdure. Et, s’il faut en croire
Maury, la chaleur de ce courant, totalement utilisée. fournirait assez de
calorique pour tenir en fusion un fleuve de fer fondu aussi grand que
l’Amazone ou le Missouri. »
En ce moment, la vitesse du Gulf−Stream était de deux mètres vingt−cinq
par seconde. Son courant est tellement distinct de la mer ambiante, que ses
eaux comprimées font saillie sur l’Océan et qu’un dénivellement s’opère
entre elles et les eaux froides. Sombres d’ailleurs et très riches en matières
salines, elles tranchent par leur pur indigo sur les flots verts qui les
environnent. Telle est même la netteté de leur ligne de démarcation, que le
Nautilus, à la hauteur des Carolines, trancha de son éperon les flots du
Gulf−Stream, tandis que son hélice battait encore ceux de l’Océan.
Ce courant entraînait avec lui tout un monde d’êtres vivants. Les
argonautes, si communs dans la Méditerranée, y voyageaient par troupes
nombreuses. Parmi les cartilagineux, les plus remarquables étaient des
raies dont la queue très déliée formait à peu près le tiers du corps, et qui
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 468
figuraient de vastes losanges longs de vingt−cinq pieds ; puis, de petits
squales d’un mètre, à tête grande, à museau court et arrondi, à dents
pointues disposées sur plusieurs rangs, et dont le corps paraissait couvert
d’écailles.
Parmi les poissons osseux, je notai des labres−grisons particuliers à ces
mers, des spares−synagres dont l’iris brillait comme un feu, des sciènes
longues d’un mètre, à large gueule hérissée de petites dents. qui faisaient
entendre un léger cri des centronotes−nègres dont j’ai déjà parlé, des
coriphènes bleus, relevés d’or et d’argent. des perroquets, vrais
arcs−en−ciel de l’Océan. qui peuvent rivaliser de couleur avec les plus
beaux oiseaux des tropiques des blémies−bosquiens à tête triangulaire,
des rhombes bleuâtres dépourvus d’écailles, des batrachoïdes recouverts
d’une bande jaune et transversale qui figure un t grec, des fourmillements
de petits gohies−hoc pointillés de taches brunes, des diptérodons à tête
argentée et à queue jaune, divers échantillons de salmones, des
mugilomores, sveltes de taille. brillant d’un éclat doux, que Lacépède a
consacrés à l’aimable compagne de sa vie, enfin un beau poisson, le
chevalier−américain, qui, décoré de tous les ordres et chamarré de tous
les rubans, fréquente les rivages de cette grande nation où les rubans et les
ordres sont si médiocrement estimés.
J’ajouterai que, pendant la nuit, les eaux phosphorescentes du
Gulf−Stream rivalisaient avec l’éclat électrique de notre fanal, surtout par
ces temps orageux qui nous menaçaient fréquemment.
Le 8 mai, nous étions encore en travers du cap Hatteras, à la hauteur de la
Caroline du Nord. La largeur du Gulf−Stream est là de soixante−quinze
milles, et sa profondeur de deux cent dix mètres. Le Nautilus continuait
d’errer à l’aventure. Toute surveillance semblait bannie du bord. Je
conviendrai que dans ces conditions, une évasion pouvait réussir. En effet,
les rivages habités offraient partout de faciles refuges. La mer était
incessamment sillonnée de nombreux steamers qui font le service entre
New York ou Boston et le golfe du Mexique, et nuit et jour parcourue par
ces petites goëlettes chargées du cabotage sur les divers points de la côte
américaine. On pouvait espérer d’être recueilli. C’était donc une occasion
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 469
favorable, malgré les trente milles qui séparaient le Nautilus des côtes de
l’Union.
Mais une circonstance fâcheuse contrariait absolument les projets du
Canadien. Le temps était fort mauvais. Nous approchions de ces parages
où les tempêtes sont fréquentes, de cette patrie des trombes et des
cyclones, précisément engendrés par le courant du Gulf−Stream. Affronter
une mer souvent démontée sur un frêle canot, c’était courir à une perte
certaine. Ned Land en convenait lui−même. Aussi rongeait−il son frein,
pris d’une furieuse nostalgie que la fuite seule eût pu guérir.
« Monsieur, me dit−il ce jour−là, il faut que cela finisse. Je veux en avoir
le coeur net. Votre Nemo s’écarte des terres et remonte vers le nord. Mais
je vous le déclare j’ai assez du pôle Sud, et je ne le suivrai pas au pôle
Nord.
— Que faire, Ned, puisqu’une évasion est impraticable en ce moment ?
— J’en reviens à mon idée. Il faut parler au capitaine. Vous n’avez rien
dit, quand nous étions dans les mers de votre pays. Je veux parler,
maintenant que nous sommes dans les mers du mien. Quand je songe
qu’avant quelques jours, le Nautilus va se trouver à la hauteur de la
Nouvelle−Ecosse, et que là, vers Terre−Neuve, s’ouvre une large baie,
que dans cette baie se jette le Saint−Laurent et que le Saint−Laurent, c’est
mon fleuve à moi le fleuve de Québec, ma ville natale ; quand je songe à
cela, la fureur me monte au visage, mes cheveux se hérissent. Tenez,
monsieur, je me jetterai plutôt à la mer ! Je ne resterai pas ici ! J’y
étouffe ! »
Le Canadien était évidemment à bout de patience. Sa vigoureuse nature ne
pouvait s’accommoder de cet emprisonnement prolongé. Sa physionomie
s’altérait de jour en jour. Son caractère devenait de plus en plus sombre.
Près de sept mois s’étaient écoulés sans que nous eussions eu aucune
nouvelle de la terre. De plus, l’isolement du capitaine Nemo, son humeur
modifiée, surtout depuis le combat des poulpes, sa taciturnité, tout me
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 470
faisait apparaître les choses sous un aspect différent. Je ne sentais plus
l’enthousiasme des premiers jours. Il fallait être un Flamand comme
Conseil pour accepter cette situation, dans ce milieu réservé aux cétacés et
autres habitants de la mer. Véritablement, si ce brave garçon, au lieu de
poumons avait eu des branchies, je crois qu’il aurait fait un poisson
distingué !
« Eh bien, monsieur ? reprit Ned Land, voyant que je ne répondais pas.
— Eh bien, Ned, vous voulez que je demande au capitaine Nemo quelles
sont ses intentions à notre égard ?
— Oui, monsieur.
— Et cela, quoiqu’il les ait déjà fait connaître ?
— Oui. Je désire être fixé une dernière fois. Parlez pour moi seul, en mon
seul nom, si vous voulez.
— Mais je le rencontre rarement. Il m’évite même.
— C’est une raison de plus pour l’aller voir.
— Je l’interrogerai, Ned.
— Quand ? demanda le Canadien en insistant.
— Quand je le rencontrerai.
— Monsieur Aronnax, voulez−vous que j’aille le trouver, moi ?
— Non, laissez−moi faire. Demain...
— Aujourd’hui, dit Ned Land.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 471
— Soit. Aujourd’hui, je le verrai », répondis−je au Canadien, qui, en
agissant lui−même, eût certainement tout compromis.
Je restai seul. La demande décidée, je résolus d’en finir immédiatement.
J’aime mieux chose faite que chose à faire.
Je rentrai dans ma chambre. De là, j’entendis marcher dans celle du
capitaine Nemo. Il ne fallait pas laisser échapper cette occasion de le
rencontrer. Je frappai à sa porte. Je n’obtins pas de réponse. Je frappai de
nouveau, puis je tournai le bouton. La porte s’ouvrit.
J’entrai. Le capitaine était là. Courbé sur sa table de travail, il ne m’avait
pas entendu. Résolu à ne pas sortir sans l’avoir interrogé, je m’approchai
de lui. Il releva la tête brusquement, fronça les sourcils, et me dit d’un ton
assez rude :
« Vous ici ! Que me voulez−vous ?
— Vous parler, capitaine.
— Mais je suis occupé, monsieur, je travaille. Cette liberté que je vous
laisse de vous isoler, ne puis−je l’avoir pour moi ? »
La réception était peu encourageante. Mais j’étais décidé à tout entendre
pour tout répondre.
« Monsieur, dis−je froidement, j’ai à vous parler d’une affaire qu’il ne
m’est pas permis de retarder.
— Laquelle, monsieur ? répondit−il ironiquement. Avez−vous fait quelque
découverte qui m’ait échappé ? La mer vous a−t−elle livré de nouveaux
secrets ? »
Nous étions loin de compte. Mais avant que j’eusse répondu, me montrant
un manuscrit ouvert sur sa table, il me dit d’un ton plus grave :
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 472
« Voici, monsieur Aronnax, un manuscrit écrit en plusieurs langues. Il
contient le résumé de mes études sur la mer, et, s’il plaît à Dieu, il ne
périra pas avec moi. Ce manuscrit, signé de mon nom, complété par
l’histoire de ma vie, sera renfermé dans un petit appareil insubmersible.
Le dernier survivant de nous tous à bord du Nautilus jettera cet appareil à
la mer, et il ira où les flots le porteront. »
Le nom de cet homme ! Son histoire écrite par lui−même ! Son mystère
serait donc un jour dévoilé ? Mais, en ce moment, je ne vis dans cette
communication qu’une entrée en matière.
« Capitaine, répondis−je, je ne puis qu’approuver la pensée qui vous fait
agir. Il ne faut pas que le fruit de vos études soit perdu. Mais le moyen que
vous employez me paraît primitif. Qui sait où les vents pousseront cet
appareil, en quelles mains il tombera ? Ne sauriez−vous trouver mieux ?
Vous, ou l’un des vôtres ne peut−il... ?
— Jamais, monsieur, dit vivement le capitaine en m’interrompant.
— Mais moi, mes compagnons, nous sommes prêts à garder ce manuscrit
en réserve, et si vous nous rendez la liberté...
— La liberté ! fit le capitaine Nemo se levant.
— Oui, monsieur, et c’est à ce sujet que je voulais vous interroger. Depuis
sept mois nous sommes à votre bord, et je vous demande aujourd’hui, au
nom de mes compagnons comme au mien, si votre intention est de nous y
garder toujours.
— Monsieur Aronnax, dit le capitaine Nemo, je vous répondrai
aujourd’hui ce que je vous ai répondu il y a sept mois : Qui entre dans le
Nautilus ne doit plus le quitter.
C’est l’esclavage même que vous nous imposez.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 473
— Donnez−lui le nom qu’il vous plaira.
— Mais partout l’esclave garde le droit de recouvrer sa liberté ! Quels que
soient les moyens qui s’offrent à lui, il peut les croire bons !
— Ce droit, répondit le capitaine Nemo, qui vous le dénie ? Ai−je jamais
pensé à vous enchaîner par un serment ? »
Le capitaine me regardait en se croisant les bras.
« Monsieur, lui dis−je, revenir une seconde fois sur ce sujet ne serait ni de
votre goût ni du mien. Mais puisque nous l’avons entamé, épuisons−le. Je
vous le répète, ce n’est pas seulement de ma personne qu’il s’agit. Pour
moi l’étude est un secours, une diversion puissante, un entraînement, une
passion qui peut me faire tout oublier. Comme vous, je suis homme à vivre
ignoré, obscur, dans le fragile espoir de léguer un jour à l’avenir le
résultat de mes travaux, au moyen d’un appareil hypothétique confié au
hasard des flots et des vents. En un mot, je puis vous admirer, vous suivre
sans déplaisir dans un rôle que je comprends sur certains points : mais il
est encore d’autres aspects de votre vie qui me la font entrevoir entourée
de complications et de mystères auxquels seuls ici, mes compagnons et
moi, nous n’avons aucune part. Et même, quand notre coeur a pu battre
pour vous, ému par quelques−unes de vos douleurs ou remué par vos actes
de génie ou de courage, nous avons dû refouler en nous jusqu’au plus petit
témoignage de cette sympathie que fait naître la vue de ce qui est beau et
bon, que cela vienne de l’ami ou de l’ennemi. Eh bien, c’est ce sentiment
que nous sommes étrangers à tout ce qui vous touche, qui fait de notre
position quelque chose d’inacceptable, d’impossible, même pour moi mais
d’impossible pour Ned Land surtout. Tout homme, par cela seul qu’il est
homme, vaut qu’on songe à lui. Vous êtes−vous demandé ce que l’amour
de la liberté, la haine de l’esclavage, pouvaient faire naître de projets de
vengeance dans une nature comme celle du Canadien, ce qu’il pouvait
penser, tenter, essayer ? ... »
Je m’étais tu. Le capitaine Nemo se leva.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 474
« Que Ned Land pense, tente, essaye tout ce qu’il voudra, que m’importe ?
Ce n’est pas moi qui l’ai été chercher ! Ce n’est pas pour mon plaisir que
je le garde à mon bord ! Quant à vous, monsieur Aronnax, vous êtes de
ceux qui peuvent tout comprendre, même le silence. Je n’ai rien de plus à
vous répondre. Que cette première fois où vous venez de traiter ce sujet
soit aussi la dernière, car une seconde fois, je ne pourrais même pas vous
écouter. »
Je me retirai. A compter de ce jour, notre situation fut très tendue. Je
rapportai ma conversation à mes deux compagnons.
« Nous savons maintenant, dit Ned, qu’il n’y a rien à attendre de cet
homme. Le Nautilus se rapproche de Long−Island. Nous fuirons, quel que
soit le temps. »
Mais le ciel devenait de plus en plus menaçant. Des symptômes d’ouragan
se manifestaient. L’atmosphère se faisait blanchâtre et laiteuse. Aux
cyrrhus à gerbes déliées succédaient à l’horizon des couches de
nimbocumulus. D’autres nuages bas fuyaient rapidement. La mer
grossissait et se gonflait en longues houles. Les oiseaux disparaissaient, à
l’exception des satanicles, amis des tempêtes. Le baromètre baissait
notablement et indiquait dans l’air une extrême tension des vapeurs. Le
mélange du storm−glass se décomposait sous l’influence de l’électricité
qui saturait l’atmosphère. La lutte des éléments était prochaine.
La tempête éclata dans la journée du 18 mai, précisément lorsque le
Nautilus flottait à la hauteur de Long−Island, à quelques milles des passes
de New York. Je puis décrire cette lutte des éléments, car au lieu de la fuir
dans les profondeurs de la mer, le capitaine Nemo, par un inexplicable
caprice, voulut la braver à sa surface.
Le vent soufflait du sud−ouest, d’abord en grand frais, c’est−à−dire avec
une vitesse de quinze mètres à la seconde, qui fut portée à vingt−cinq
mètres vers trois heures du soir. C’est le chiffre des tempêtes.
Le capitaine Nemo, inébranlable sous les rafales, avait pris place sur la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 475
plate−forme. Il s’était amarré à mi−corps pour résister aux vagues
monstrueuses qui déferlaient. Je m’y étais hissé et attaché aussi,
partageant mon admiration entre cette tempête et cet homme
incomparable qui lui tenait tête.
La mer démontée était balayée par de grandes loques de nuages qui
trempaient dans ses flots. Je ne voyais plus aucune de ces petites lames
intermédiaires qui se forment au fond des grands creux. Rien que de
longues ondulations fuligineuses, dont la crête ne déferle pas, tant elles
sont compactes. Leur hauteur s’accroissait. Elles s’excitaient entre elles.
Le Nautilus, tantôt couché sur le côté, tantôt dressé comme un mât, roulait
et tanguait épouvantablement.
Vers cinq heures, une pluie torrentielle tomba, qui n’abattit ni le vent ni la
mer. L’ouragan se déchaîna avec une vitesse de quarante−cinq mètres à la
seconde, soit près de quarante lieues à l’heure. C’est dans ces conditions
qu’il renverse des maisons, qu’il enfonce des tuiles de toits dans des
portes, qu’il rompt des grilles de fer, qu’il déplace des canons de
vingt−quatre. Et pourtant le Nautilus, au milieu de la tourmente, justifiait
cette parole d’un savant ingénieur : « Il n’y a pas de coque bien construite
qui ne puisse défier à la mer ! » Ce n’était pas un roc résistant, que ces
lames eussent démoli, c’était un fuseau d’acier, obéissant et mobile, sans
gréement, sans mâture, qui bravait impunément leur fureur.
Cependant j’examinais attentivement ces vagues déchaînées. Elles
mesuraient jusqu’à quinze mètres de hauteur sur une longueur de cent
cinquante a cent soixante−quinze mètres, et leur vitesse de propagation.
moitié de celle du vent, était de quinze mètres à la seconde. Leur volume et
leur puissance s’accroissaient avec la profondeur des eaux. Je compris
alors le rôle de ces lames qui emprisonnent l’air dans leurs flancs et le
refoulent au fond des mers où elles portent la vie avec l’oxygène. Leur
extrême force de pression — on l’a calculée peut s’élever jusqu’à trois
mille kilogrammes par pied carré de la surface qu’elles contrebattent. Ce
sont de telles lames qui, aux Hébrides, ont déplacé un bloc pesant
quatre−vingt−quatre mille livres. Ce sont elles qui, dans la tempête du 23
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 476
décembre 1864, après avoir renversé une partie de la ville de Yéddo, au
Japon, faisant sept cents kilomètres à l’heure, allèrent se briser le même
jour sur les rivages de l’Amérique.
L’intensité de la tempête s’accrut avec la nuit. Le baromètre, comme en
1860, à la Réunion, pendant un cyclone, tomba à 710 millimètres. A la
chute du jour, je vis passer à l’horizon un grand navire qui luttait
péniblement. Il capeyait sous petite vapeur pour se maintenir debout à la
lame. Ce devait être un des steamers des lignes de New York à Liverpool
ou au Havre. Il disparut bientôt dans l’ombre.
A dix heures du soir, le ciel était en feu. L’atmosphère fut zébrée d’éclairs
violents. Je ne pouvais en supporter l’éclat, tandis que le capitaine Nemo,
les regardant en face, semblait aspirer en lui l’âme de la tempête. Un bruit
terrible emplissait les airs, bruit complexe, fait des hurlements des vagues
écrasées, des mugissements du vent, des éclats du tonnerre. Le vent sautait
à tous les points de l’horizon, et le cyclone, partant de l’est, y revenait en
passant par le nord, l’ouest et le sud, en sens inverse des tempêtes
tournantes de l’hémisphère austral.
Ah ! ce Gulf−Stream ! Il justifiait bien son nom de roi des tempêtes ! C’est
lui qui crée ces formidables cyclones par la différence de température des
couches d’air superposées a ses courants.
A la pluie avait succédé une averse de feu. Les gouttelettes d’eau se
changeaient en aigrettes fulminantes. On eût dit que le capitaine Nemo,
voulant une mort digne de lui, cherchait à se faire foudroyer. Dans un
effroyable mouvement de tangage, le Nautilus dressa en l’air son éperon
d’acier, comme la tige d’un paratonnerre, et j’en vis jaillir de longues
étincelles.
Brisé, à bout de forces, je me coulai à plat ventre vers le panneau. Je
l’ouvris et je redescendis au salon. L’orage atteignait alors son maximum
d’intensité. Il était impossible de se tenir debout à l’intérieur du Nautilus.
Le capitaine Nemo rentra vers minuit. J’entendis les réservoirs se remplir
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Le gulf−stream 477
peu à peu, et le Nautilus s’enfonça doucement au−dessous de la surface
des flots.
Par les vitres ouvertes du salon, je vis de grands poissons effarés qui
passaient comme des fantômes dans les eaux en feu. Quelques−uns furent
foudroyés sous mes yeux !
Le Nautilus descendait toujours. Je pensais qu’il retrouverait le calme à
une profondeur de quinze mètres. Non. Les couches supérieures étaient
trop violemment agitées. Il fallut aller chercher le repos jusqu’à cinquante
mètres dans les entrailles de la mer.
Mais là, quelle tranquillité, quel silence, quel milieu paisible ! Qui eût dit
qu’un ouragan terrible se déchaînait alors à la surface de cet Océan ?

A la suite de cette tempête, nous avions été rejetés dans l’est. Tout espoir
de s’évader sur les atterrages de New York ou du Saint−Laurent
s’évanouissait. Le pauvre Ned, désespéré, s’isola comme le capitaine
Nemo. Conseil et moi, nous ne nous quittions plus.
J’ai dit que le Nautilus s’était écarté dans l’est. J’aurais dû dire, plus
exactement, dans le nord−est. Pendant quelques jours, il erra tantôt à la
surface des flots, tantôt au−dessous, au milieu de ces brumes si
redoutables aux navigateurs. Elles sont principalement dues à la fonte des
glaces, qui entretient une extrême humidité dans l’atmosphère. Que de
navires perdus dans ces parages, lorsqu’ils allaient reconnaître les feux
incertains de la côte ! Que de sinistres dus à ces brouillards opaques ! Que
de chocs sur ces écueils dont le ressac est éteint par le bruit du vent ! Que
de collisions entre les bâtiments, malgré leurs feux de position, malgré les
avertissements de leurs sifflets et de leurs cloches d’alarme !
Aussi, le fond de ces mers offrait−il l’aspect d’un champ de bataille, où
gisaient encore tous ces vaincus de l’Océan ; les uns vieux et empâtés
déjà ; les autres jeunes et réfléchissant l’éclat de notre fanal sur leurs
ferrures et leurs carènes de cuivre. Parmi eux, que de bâtiments perdus
corps et biens, avec leurs équipages, leur monde d’émigrants, sur ces
points dangereux signalés dans les statistiques, le cap Race, l’île
Saint−Paul, le détroit de Belle−Ile, l’estuaire du Saint−Laurent ! Et
depuis quelques années seulement que de victimes fournies à ces funèbres
annales par les lignes du Royal−Mail, d’Inmann, de Montréal, le Solway,
I’Isis, le Paramatta, I’Hungarian, le Canadian, l’Anglo−Saxon, le
Humboldt, l’United−States, tous échoués, l’Artic, le Lyonnais, coulés par
abordage, le Président, le Pacific, le City−of−Glasgow, disparus pour des
causes ignorées, sombres débris au milieu desquels naviguait le Nautilus,
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 479
comme s’il eût passé une revue des morts !
Le 15 mai, nous étions sur l’extrémité méridionale du banc de
Terre−Neuve. Ce banc est un produit des alluvions marines, un amas
considérable de ces détritus organiques, amenés soit de l’Équateur par le
courant du Gulf−Stream, soit du pôle boréal, par ce contre−courant d’eau
froide qui longe la côte américaine. Là aussi s’amoncellent les blocs
erratiques charriés par la débâcle des glaces. Là s’est formé un vaste
ossuaire de poissons de mollusques ou de zoophytes qui y périssent par
milliards.
La profondeur de la mer n’est pas considérable au banc de Terre−Neuve.
Quelques centaines de brasses au plus. Mais vers le sud se creuse
subitement une dépression profonde, un trou de trois mille mètres. Là
s’élargit le Gulf−Stream. C’est un épanouissement de ses eaux. Il perd de
sa vitesse et de sa température, mais il devient une mer.
Parmi les poissons que le Nautilus effaroucha à son passage, je citerai le
cycloptère d’un mètre, à dos noirâtre, à ventre orange, qui donne à ses
congénères un exemple peu suivi de fidélité conjugale, un unernack de
grande taille, sorte de murène émeraude, d’un goût excellent, des karraks
à gros yeux, dont la tête a quelque ressemblance avec celle du chien, des
blennies, ovovivipares comme les serpents, des gobies−boulerots ou
goujons noirs de deux décimètres, des macroures à longue queue, brillant
d’un éclat argenté, poissons rapides, aventurés loin des mers
hyperboréennes.
Les filets ramassèrent aussi un poisson hardi, audacieux, vigoureux, bien
musclé, armé de piquants à la tête et d’aiguillons aux nageoires, véritable
scorpion de deux à trois mètres, ennemi acharné des blennies, des gades et
des saumons, c’était le cotte des mers septentrionales. au corps
tuberculeux, brun de couleur, rouge aux nageoires. Les pêcheurs du
Nautilus eurent quelque peine à s’emparer de cet animal, qui, grâce à la
conformation de ses opercules, préserve ses organes respiratoires du
contact desséchant de l’atmosphère et peut vivre quelque temps hors de
l’eau.

Je cite maintenant — pour mémoire — des bosquiens, petits poissons qui
accompagnent longtemps les navires dans les mers boréales, des
ables−oxyrhinques, spéciaux à l’Atlantique septentrional, des rascasses, et
j’arrive aux gades, principalement à l’espèce morue, que je surpris dans
ses eaux de prédilection, sur cet inépuisable banc de Terre−Neuve.
On peut dire que ces morues sont des poissons de montagnes, car
Terre−Neuve n’est qu’une montagne sous−marine. Lorsque le Nautilus
s’ouvrit un chemin à travers leurs phalanges pressées, Conseil ne put
retenir cette observation :
« Ça ! des morues ! dit−il ; mais je croyais que les morues étaient plates
comme des limandes ou des soles ?
— Naïf ! m’écriai−je. Les morues ne sont plates que chez l’épicier, où on
les montre ouvertes et étalées. Mais dans l’eau, ce sont des poissons
fusiformes comme les mulets, et parfaitement conformés pour la marche
.
— Je veux croire monsieur, répondit Conseil. Quelle nuée, quelle
fourmilière !
— Eh ! mon ami, il y en aurait bien davantage, sans leurs ennemis, les
rascasses et les hommes ! Sais−tu combien on a compté d’oeufs dans une
seule femelle ?
— Faisons bien les choses, répondit Conseil. Cinq cent mille.
— Onze millions, mon ami.
— Onze millions. Voila ce que je n’admettrai jamais, à moins de les
compter moi−même.
— Compte−les, Conseil. Mais tu auras plus vite fait de me croire.
D’ailleurs, c’est par milliers que les Français, les Anglais, les Américains,
les Danois, les Norvégiens. pêchent les morues. On les consomme en
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 481
quantités prodigieuses, et sans l’étonnante fécondité de ces poissons, les
mers en seraient bientôt dépeuplées. Ainsi en Angleterre et en Amérique
seulement, cinq mille navires montés par soixante−quinze mille marins,
sont employés à la pêche de la morue. Chaque navire en rapporte
quarante mille en moyenne, ce qui fait vingt−cinq millions. Sur les côtes
de la Norvège, même résultat.
— Bien, répondit Conseil, je m’en rapporte à monsieur. Je ne les
compterai pas.
— Quoi donc ?
— Les onze millions d’oeufs. Mais je ferai une remarque.
— Laquelle ?
— C’est que si tous les oeufs éclosaient, il suffirait de quatre morues pour
alimenter l’Angleterre, l’Amérique et la Norvège. »
Pendant que nous effleurions les fonds du banc de Terre−Neuve, je vis
parfaitement ces longues lignes, armées de deux cents hameçons, que
chaque bateau tend par douzaines. Chaque ligne entraînée par un bout au
moyen d’un petit grappin, était retenue a la surface par un orin fixé sur
une bouée de liège. Le Nautilus dut manoeuvrer adroitement au milieu de
ce réseau sous−marin.
D’ailleurs il ne demeura pas longtemps dans ces parages fréquentés. Il
s’éleva jusque vers le quarante−deuxième degré de latitude. C’était à la
hauteur de Saint−Jean de Terre−Neuve et de Heart’s Content, où aboutit
l’extrémité du câble transatlantique.
Le Nautilus, au lieu de continuer à marcher au nord prit direction vers
l’est, comme s’il voulait suivre ce plateau télégraphique sur lequel repose
le câble, et dont des sondages multipliés ont donné le relief avec une
extrême exactitude.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 482
Ce fut le 17 mai, à cinq cents milles environ de Heart’sContent, par deux
mille huit cents mètres de profondeur, que j’aperçus le câble gisant sur le
sol. Conseil, que je n’avais pas prévenu, le prit d’abord pour un
gigantesque serpent de mer et s’apprêtait à le classer suivant sa méthode
ordinaire. Mais je désabusai le digne garçon et pour le consoler de son
déboire, je lui appris diverses particularités de la pose de ce câble.
Le premier câble fut établi pendant les années 1857 et 1
858 ; mais, après avoir transmis quatre cents télégrammes environ, il
cessa de fonctionner. En 1863, les ingénieurs construisirent un nouveau
câble, mesurant trois mille quatre cents kilomètres et pesant quatre mille
cinq cents tonnes, qui fut embarqué sur le Great−Eastern. Cette tentative
échoua encore.
Or, le 25 mai, le Nautilus, immergé par trois mille huit cent trente−six
mètres de profondeur, se trouvait précisément en cet endroit où se
produisit la rupture qui ruina l’entreprise. C’était à six cent trente−huit
milles de la côte d’Irlande. On s’aperçut, à deux heures après−midi, que
les communications avec l’Europe venaient de s’interrompre. Les
électriciens du bord résolurent de couper le câble avant de le repêcher, et
à onze heures du soir, ils avaient ramené la partie avariée. On refit un
joint et une épissure ; puis le câble fut immergé de nouveau. Mais,
quelques jours plus tard, il se rompit et ne put être ressaisi dans les
profondeurs de l’Océan.
Les Américains ne se découragèrent pas. L’audacieux Cyrus Field, le
promoteur de l’entreprise, qui y risquait toute sa fortune, provoqua une
nouvelle souscription. Elle fut immédiatement couverte. Un autre câble fut
établi dans de meilleures conditions. Le faisceau de fils conducteurs isolés
dans une enveloppe de gutta−percha, était protégé par un matelas de
matières textiles contenu dans une armature métallique. Le Great−Eastern
reprit la mer le 13 juillet 1866.
L’opération marcha bien. Cependant un incident arriva. Plusieurs fois, en
déroulant le câble, les électriciens observèrent que des clous y avaient été
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 483
récemment enfoncés dans le but d’en détériorer l’âme. Le capitaine
Anderson, ses officiers, ses ingénieurs, se réunirent, délibérèrent, et firent
afficher que si le coupable était surpris à bord, il serait jeté à la mer sans
autre jugement. Depuis lors, la criminelle tentative ne se reproduisit plus.
Le 23 juillet, le Great−Eastern n’était plus qu’à huit cents kilomètres de
Terre−Neuve, lorsqu’on lui télégraphia d’Irlande la nouvelle de
l’armistice conclu entre la Prusse et l’Autriche après Sadowa. Le 27, il
relevait au milieu des brumes le port de Heart’s Content. L’entreprise était
heureusement terminée, et par sa première dépêche, la jeune Amérique
adressait à la vieille Europe ces sages paroles si rarement comprises : «
Gloire à Dieu dans le ciel, et paix aux hommes de bonne volonté sur la
terre. »
Je ne m’attendais pas à trouver le câble électrique dans son état primitif,
tel qu’il était en sortant des ateliers de fabrication. Le long serpent,
recouvert de débris de coquille, hérissé de foraminifères, était encroûté
dans un empâtement pierreux qui le protégeait contre les mollusques
perforants. Il reposait tranquillement, à l’abri des mouvements de la mer,
et sous une pression favorable à la transmission de l’étincelle électrique
qui passe de l’Amérique à l’Europe en trente−deux centièmes de seconde.
La durée de ce câble sera infinie sans doute, car on a observé que
l’enveloppe de gutta−percha s’améliore par son séjour dans l’eau de mer.
D’ailleurs, sur ce plateau si heureusement choisi, le câble n’est jamais
immergé à des profondeurs telles qu’il puisse se rompre. Le Nautilus le
suivit jusqu’à son fond le plus bas, situé par quatre mille quatre cent trente
et un mètres, et là, il reposait encore sans aucun effort de traction. Puis,
nous nous rapprochâmes de l’endroit où avait eu lieu l’accident de 1863.
Le fond océanique formait alors une vallée large de cent vingt kilomètres,
sur laquelle on eût pu poser le Mont−Blanc sans que son sommet émergeât
de la surface des flots. Cette vallée est fermée à l’est par une muraille à
pic de deux mille mètres. Nous y arrivions le 28 mai, et le Nautilus n’était
plus qu’à cent cinquante kilomètres de l’Irlande.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 484
Le capitaine Nemo allait−il remonter pour atterrir sur les îles
Britanniques ? Non. A ma grande surprise, il redescendit au sud et revint
vers les mers européennes. En contournant l’île d’Émeraude, j’aperçus un
instant le cap Clear et le feu de Fastenet, qui éclaire les milliers de navires
sortis de Glasgow ou de Liverpool.
Une importante question se posait alors à mon esprit.
Le Nautilus oserait−il s’engager dans la Manche ? Ned Land qui avait
reparu depuis que nous rallions la terre ne cessait de m’interroger.
Comment lui répondre ? Le capitaine Nemo demeurait invisible. Après
avoir laissé entrevoir au Canadien les rivages d’Amérique, allait−il donc
me montrer les côtes de France ?
Cependant le Nautilus s’abaissait toujours vers le sud. Le 30 mai, il
passait en vue du Land’s End, entre la pointe extrême de l’Angleterre et
les Sorlingues, qu’il laissa sur tribord.
S’il voulait entrer en Manche, il lui fallait prendre franchement à l’est. Il
ne le fit pas.
Pendant toute la journée du 31 mai, le Nautilus décrivit sur la mer une
série de cercles qui m’intriguèrent vivement. Il semblait chercher un
endroit qu’il avait quelque peine à trouver. A midi, le capitaine Nemo vint
faire son point lui−même. Il ne m’adressa pas la parole. Il me parut plus
sombre que jamais. Qui pouvait l’attrister ainsi ? Était−ce sa proximité
des rivages européens ? Sentait−il quelque ressouvenir de son pays
abandonné ? Qu’éprouvait−il alors ? des remords ou des regrets ?
Longtemps cette pensée occupa mon esprit, et j’eus comme un
pressentiment que le hasard trahirait avant peu les secrets du capitaine.
Le lendemain, 31 juin, le Nautilus conserva les mêmes allures. Il était
évident qu’il cherchait à reconnaître un point précis de l’Océan. Le
capitaine Nemo vint prendre la hauteur du soleil, ainsi qu’il avait fait la
veille. La mer était belle, le ciel pur. A huit milles dans l’est, un grand
navire à vapeur se dessinait sur la ligne de l’horizon. Aucun pavillon ne
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 485
battait à sa corne, et je ne pus reconnaître sa nationalité.
Le capitaine Nemo, quelques minutes avant que le soleil passât au
méridien, prit son sextant et observa avec une précision extrême. Le calme
absolu des flots facilitait son opération. Le Nautilus immobile ne ressentait
ni roulis ni tangage.
J’étais en ce moment sur la plate−forme. Lorsque son relèvement fut
terminé, le capitaine prononça ces seuls mots.
« C’est ici ! »
Il redescendit par le panneau. Avait−il vu le bâtiment qui modifiait sa
marche et semblait se rapprocher de nous ? Je ne saurais le dire.
Je revins au salon. Le panneau se ferma, et j’entendis les sifflements de
l’eau dans les réservoirs. Le Nautilus commença de s’enfoncer, suivant
une ligne verticale, car son hélice entravée ne lui communiquait plus
aucun mouvement.
Quelques minutes plus tard, il s’arrêtait à une profondeur de huit cent
trente−trois mètres et reposait sur le sol.
Le plafond lumineux du salon s’éteignit alors, les panneaux s’ouvrirent, et
à travers les vitres, j’aperçus la mer vivement illuminée par les rayons du
fanal dans un ravo d’un demi−mille.
Je regardait à bâbord et je ne vis rien que l’immensité des eaux
tranquilles.
Par tribord, sur le fond, apparaissait une forte extumescence qui attira
mon attention. On eût dit des ruines ensevelies sous un empâtement de
coquilles blanchâtres comme sous un manteau de neige. En examinant
attentivement cette masse, je crus reconnaître les formes épaissies d’un
navire, rasé de ses mâts, qui devait avoir coulé par l’avant. Ce sinistre
datait certainement d’une époque reculée. Cette épave, pour être ainsi
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 486
encroûtée dans le calcaire des eaux, comptait déjà bien des années passées
sur ce fond de l’Océan.
Quel était ce navire ? Pourquoi le Nautilus venait−il visiter sa tombe ?
N’était−ce donc pas un naufrage qui avait entraîné ce bâtiment sous les
eaux ?
Je ne savais que penser, quand, près de moi, j’entendis le capitaine Nemo
dire d’une voix lente : « Autrefois ce navire se nommait le Marseillais. Il
portait soixante−quatorze canons et fut lancé en 1762. En 1778, le 13
août, commandé par La Poype−Vertrieux, il se battait audacieusement
contre le Preston. En 1779, le 4 juillet, il assistait avec l’escadre de
l’amiral d’Estaing à la prise de Grenade. En 1781, le 5 septembre, il
prenait part au combat du comte de Grasse dans la baie de la Chesapeak.
En 1794, la république française lui changeait son nom. Le 16 avril de la
même année, il rejoignait à Brest l’escadre de Villaret−Joyeuse ? chargé
d’escorter un convoi de blé qui venait d’Amérique sous le commandement
de l’amiral Van Stabel. Le 11 et le 12 prairial, an II, cette escadre se
rencontrait avec les vaisseaux anglais. Monsieur, c’est aujourd’hui le 13
prairial, le ler juin 1868. Il y a soixante−quatorze ans, jour pour jour, à
cette place même, par 47°24’de latitude et 17°28’de longitude, ce navire,
après un combat héroïque, démâté de ses trois mâts, l’eau dans ses soutes,
le tiers de son équipage hors de combat, aima mieux s’engloutir avec ses
trois cent cinquante−six marins que de se rendre, et clouant son pavillon à
sa poupe, il disparut sous les flots au cri de : Vive la République !
— Le Vengeur ! m’écriai−je.
— Oui ! monsieur. Le Vengeur ! Un beau nom ! » murmura le capitaine
Nemo en se croisant les bras.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Par 47°24' de latitude et de 17°28 de... 487
Une hécatombe
Cette façon de dire, l’imprévu de cette scène, cet historique du navire
patriote froidement raconté d’abord, puis l’émotion avec laquelle
l’étrange personnage avait prononcé ses dernières paroles, ce nom de
Vengeur, dont la signification ne pouvait m’échapper, tout se réunissait
pour frapper profondément mon esprit. Mes regards ne quittaient plus le
capitaine. Lui, les mains tendues vers la mer, considérait d’un oeil ardent
la glorieuse épave. Peut−être ne devais−je jamais savoir qui il était, d’où
il venait, où il allait, mais je voyais de plus en plus l’homme se dégager du
savant. Ce n’était pas une misanthropie commune qui avait enfermé dans
les flancs du Nautilus le capitaine Nemo et ses compagnons, mais une
haine monstrueuse ou sublime que le temps ne pouvait affaiblir.
Cette haine cherchait−elle encore des vengeances ? L’avenir devait
bientôt me l’apprendre.
Cependant, le Nautilus remontait lentement vers la surface de la mer, et je
vis disparaître peu à peu les formes confuses du Vengeur. Bientôt un léger
roulis m’indiqua que nous flottions à l’air libre.
En ce moment, une sourde détonation se fit entendre. Je regardai le
capitaine. Le capitaine ne bougea pas.
« Capitaine ? » dis−je.
Il ne répondit pas.
Je le quittai et montai sur la plate−forme. Conseil et le Canadien m’y
avaient précédé.
« D’où vient cette détonation ? demandai−je.
Une hécatombe 488
— Un coup de canon », répondit Ned Land.
Je regardai dans la direction du navire que j’avais aperçu. Il s’était
rapproché du Nautilus et l’on voyait qu’il forçait de vapeur. Six milles le
séparaient de nous.
« Quel est ce bâtiment, Ned ?
— A son gréement, à la hauteur de ses bas mâts, répondit le Canadien, je
parierais pour un navire de guerre. Puisse−t−il venir sur nous et couler,
s’il le faut, ce damné Nautilus !
— Ami Ned, répondit Conseil, quel mal peut−il faire au Nautilus ?
Ira−t−il l’attaquer sous les flots ? Ira−t−il le canonner au fond des
mers ?
— Dites−moi, Ned, demandai−je, pouvez−vous reconnaître la nationalité
de ce bâtiment ? »
Le Canadien, fronçant ses sourcils, abaissant ses paupières, plissant ses
yeux aux angles, fixa pendant quelques instants le navire de toute la
puissance de son regard.
« Non, monsieur, répondit−il. Je ne saurais reconnaître à quelle nation il
appartient. Son pavillon n’est pas hisse. Mais je puis affirmer que c’est un
navire de guerre, car une longue flamme se déroule à l’extrémité de son
grand mât. »
Pendant un quart d’heure, nous continuâmes d’observer le bâtiment qui se
dirigeait vers nous. Je ne pouvais admettre, cependant. qu’il eût reconnu
le Nautilus à cette distance, encore moins qu’il sût ce qu’était cet engin
sous−marin.
Bientôt le Canadien m’annonça que ce bâtiment était un grand vaisseau de
guerre, à éperon, un deux−ponts cuirassé. Une épaisse fumée noire
s’échappait de ses deux cheminées. Ses voiles serrées se confondaient avec
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 489
la ligne des vergues. Sa corne ne portait aucun pavillon. La distance
empêchait encore de distinguer les couleurs de sa flamme, qui flottait
comme un mince ruban.
Il s’avançait rapidement. Si le capitaine Nemo le laissait approcher, une
chance de salut s’offrait à nous.
« Monsieur, me dit Ned Land, que ce bâtiment nous passe à un mille je me
jette à la mer, et je vous engage faire comme moi. »
Je ne répondis pas à la proposition du Canadien, et je continuai de
regarder le navire qui grandissait à vue d’oeil. Qu’il fût anglais, français,
américain ou russe, il était certain qu’il nous accueillerait, si nous
pouvions gagner son bord.
« Monsieur voudra bien se rappeler, dit alors Conseil, que nous avons
quelque expérience de la natation. Il peut se reposer sur moi du soin de le
remorquer vers ce navire, s’il lui convient de suivre l’ami Ned. »
J’allais répondre, lorsqu’une vapeur blanche jaillit à l’avant du vaisseau
de guerre. Puis, quelques secondes plus tard, les eaux troublées par la
chute d’un corps pesant, éclaboussèrent l’arrière du Nautilus. Peu après,
une détonation frappait mon oreille.
« Comment ? ils tirent sur nous ! m’écriai−je.
— Braves gens ! murmura le Canadien.
— Ils ne nous prennent donc pas pour des naufragés accrochés à une
épave !
— N’en déplaise à monsieur.... Bon, fit Conseil en secouant l’eau qu’un
nouveau boulet avait fait jaillir jusqu’à lui. – N’en déplaise à monsieur, ils
ont reconnu le narwal, et ils canonnent le narwal.
— Mais ils doivent bien voir, m’écriai−je qu’ils ont affaire à des hommes.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 490
— C’est peut−être pour cela ! » répondit Ned Land en me regardant.
Toute une révélation se fit dans mon esprit. Sans doute, on savait à quoi
s’en tenir maintenant sur l’existence du prétendu monstre. Sans doute,
dans son abordage avec l’Abraham−Lincoln, lorsque le Canadien le
frappa de son harpon, le commandant Farragut avait reconnu que le
narwal était un bateau sous−marin, plus dangereux qu’un cétacé
surnaturel ?
Oui, cela devait être ainsi, et sur toutes les mers, sans doute, on
poursuivait maintenant ce terrible engin de destruction !
Terrible en effet, si comme on pouvait le supposer, le capitaine Nemo
employait le Nautilus à une oeuvre de vengeance ! Pendant cette nuit,
lorsqu’il nous emprisonna dans la cellule, au milieu de l’Océan Indien, ne
s’était−il pas attaqué à quelque navire ? Cet homme enterré maintenant
dans le cimetière de corail, n’avait−il pas été victime du choc provoqué
par le Nautilus ? Oui, je le répète. Il en devait être ainsi. Une partie de la
mystérieuse existence du capitaine Nemo se dévoilait. Et si son identité
n’était pas reconnue, du moins, les nations coalisées contre lui, chassaient
maintenant, non plus un être chimérique, mais un homme qui leur avait
voué une haine implacable !
Tout ce passé formidable apparut à mes yeux. Au lieu de rencontrer des
amis sur ce navire qui s’approchait, nous n’y pouvions trouver que des
ennemis sans pitié.
Cependant les boulets se multipliaient autour de nous. Quelques−uns,
rencontrant la surface liquide, s’en allaient par ricochet se perdre à des
distances considérables. Mais aucun n’atteignit le Nautilus.
Le navire cuirassé n’était plus alors qu’à trois milles. Malgré sa violente
canonnade, le capitaine Nemo ne paraissait pas sur la plate−forme. Et
cependant, l’un de ces boulets coniques, frappant normalement la coque
du Nautilus, lui eût été fatal.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 491
Le Canadien me dit alors :
« Monsieur, nous devons tout tenter pour nous tirer de ce mauvais pas.
Faisons des signaux ! Mille diables ! On comprendra peut−être que nous
sommes d’honnêtes gens ! »
Ned Land prit son mouchoir pour l’agiter dans l’air. Mais il l’avait à
peine déployé, que terrassé par une main de fer, malgré sa force
prodigieuse, il tombait sur le pont.
« Misérable, s’écria le capitaine, veux−tu donc que je te cloue sur
l’éperon du Nautilus avant qu’il ne se précipite contre ce navire ! »
Le capitaine Nemo, terrible à entendre, était plus terrible encore à voir. Sa
face avait pâli sous les spasmes de son coeur, qui avait dû cesser de battre
un instant. Ses pupilles s’étaient contractées effroyablement. Sa voix ne
parlait plus, elle rugissait. Le corps penché en avant, il tordait sous sa
main les épaules du Canadien.
Puis, l’abandonnant et se retournant vers le vaisseau de guerre dont les
boulets pleuvaient autour de lui :
« Ah ! tu sais qui je suis, navire d’une nation maudite ! s’écria−t−il de sa
voix puissante. Moi, je n’ai pas eu besoin de tes couleurs pour te
reconnaître ! Regarde ! Je vais te montrer les miennes ! »
Et le capitaine Nemo déploya à l’avant de la plate−forme un pavillon noir.
semblable à celui qu’il avait déjà planté au pôle sud.
A ce moment, un boulet frappant obliquement la coque du Nautilus, sans
l’entamer, et passant par ricochet près du capitaine alla se perdre en mer.
Le capitaine Nemo haussa les épaules. Puis, s’adressant à moi :
« Descendez, me dit−il d’un ton bref, descendez, vous et vos compagnons.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 492
— Monsieur, m’ecriai−je, allez−vous donc attaquer ce navire ?
— Monsieur, je vais le couler. Vous ne ferez pas cela !
— Je le ferai, répondit froidement le capitaine Nemo. Ne vous avisez pas
de me juger, monsieur. La fatalité vous montre ce que vous ne deviez pas
voir. L’attaque est venue. La riposte sera terrible. Rentrez.
— Ce navire, quel est−il ?
— Vous ne le savez pas ? Eh bien ! tant mieux ! Sa nationalité, du moins,
restera un secret pour vous. Descendez. »
Le Canadien, Conseil et moi, nous ne pouvions qu’obéir. Une quinzaine de
marins du Nautilus entouraient le capitaine et regardaient avec un
implacable sentiment de haine ce navire qui s’avançait vers eux. On
sentait que le même souffle de vengeance animait toutes ces âmes.
Je descendis au moment où un nouveau projectile éraillait encore la coque
du Nautilus, et j’entendis le capitaine s’écrier :
« Frappe, navire insensé ! Prodigue tes inutiles boulets ! Tu n’échapperas
pas à l’éperon du Nautilus. Mais ce n’est pas à cette place que tu dois
périr ! Je ne veux pas que tes ruines aillent se confondre avec les ruines du
Vengeur ! »
Je regagnai ma chambre. Le capitaine et son second étaient restés sur la
plate−forme. L’hélice fut mise en mouvement, le Nautilus, s’éloignant avec
vitesse se mit hors de la portée des boulets du vaisseau. Mais la poursuite
continua, et le capitaine Nemo se contenta de maintenir sa distance.
Vers quatre heures du soir, ne pouvant contenir l’impatience et
l’inquiétude qui me dévoraient, je revins vers l’escalier central. Le
panneau était ouvert. Je me hasardai sur la plate−forme. Le capitaine s’y
promenait encore d’un pas agité. Il regardait le navire qui lui restait sous
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 493
le vent à cinq ou six milles. Il tournait autour de lui comme une bête fauve,
et l’attirant vers l’est, il se laissait poursuivre. Cependant, il n’attaquait
pas. Peut−être hésitait−il encore ?
Je voulus intervenir une dernière fois. Mais j’avais a peine interpellé le
capitaine Nemo, que celui−ci m’imposait silence :
« Je suis le droit, je suis la justice ! me dit−il. Je suis l’opprimé, et voilà
l’oppresseur ! C’est par lui que tout ce que J’ai aime, chéri, vénéré, patrie,
femme, enfants, mon père, ma mère, j’ai vu tout périr ! Tout ce que je hais
est là ! Taisez−vous ! »
Je portai un dernier regard vers le vaisseau de guerre qui forçait de
vapeur. Puis, je rejoignis Ned et Conseil.
« Nous fuirons ! m’écriai−je.
— Bien, fit Ned. Quel est ce navire ?
— Je l’ignore. Mais quel qu’il soit, il sera coulé avant la nuit. En tout cas,
mieux vaut périr avec lui que de se faire les complices de représailles dont
on ne peut pas mesurer l’équité.
— C’est mon avis, répondit froidement Ned Land. Attendons la nuit. »
La nuit arriva. Un profond silence régnait à bord. La boussole indiquait
que le Nautilus n’avait pas modifié sa direction. J’entendais le battement
de son hélice qui frappait les flots avec une rapide régularité. Il se tenait à
la surface des eaux, et un léger roulis le portait tantôt sur un bord, tantôt
sur un autre.
Mes compagnons et moi, nous avions résolu de fuir au moment où le
vaisseau serait assez rapproché, soit pour nous faire entendre, soit pour
nous faire voir, car la lune, qui devait être pleine trois jours plus tard,
resplendissait. Une fois à bord de ce navire, si nous ne pouvions prévenir
le coup qui le menaçait, du moins nous ferions tout ce que les
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 494
circonstances nous permettaient de tenter. Plusieurs fois, je crus que le
Nautilus se disposait pour l’attaque. Mais il se contentait de laisser se
rapprocher son adversaire, et, peu de temps après, il reprenait son allure
de fuite.
Une partie de la nuit se passa sans incident. Nous guettions l’occasion
d’agir. Nous parlions peu, étant trop émus. Ned Land aurait voulu se
précipiter à la mer. Je le forçai d’attendre. Suivant moi, le Nautilus devait
attaquer le deux−ponts à la surface des flots, et alors il serait non
seulement possible, mais facile de s’enfuir.
A trois heures du matin, inquiet, je montai sur la plate−forme. Le
capitaine Nemo ne l’avait pas quittée. Il était debout, à l’avant, près de
son pavillon. qu’une légère brise déployait au−dessus de sa tête. Il ne
quittait pas le vaisseau des yeux. Son regard, d’une extraordinaire
intensité, semblait l’attirer, le fasciner, l’entraîner plus sûrement que s’il
lui eût donné la remorque !
La lune passait alors au méridien. Jupiter se levait dans l’est. Au milieu de
cette paisible nature, le ciel et l’Océan rivalisaient de tranquillité, et la
mer offrait a l’astre des nuits le plus beau miroir qui eût jamais reflété son
image.
Et quand je pensais à ce calme profond des éléments, comparé à toutes ces
colères qui couvaient dans les flancs de l’imperceptible Nautilus, je sentais
frissonner tout mon être.
Le vaisseau se tenait a deux mille de nous. Il s’était rapproché, marchant
toujours vers cet éclat phosphorescent qui signalait la présence du
Nautilus. Je vis ses feux de position, vert et rouge, et son fanal blanc
suspendu au grand étai de misaine. Une vague réverbération éclairait son
gréement et indiquait que les feux étaient poussés à outrance. Des gerbes
d’étincelles, des scories de charbons enflammés, s’échappant de ses
cheminées, étoilaient l’atmosphère.
Je demeurai ainsi jusqu’à six heures du matin, sans que le capitaine Nemo
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 495
eût paru m’apercevoir. Le vaisseau nous restait à un mille et demi, et avec
les première, lueurs du jour. sa canonnade recommença. Le moment ne
pouvait être éloigné où, le Nautilus attaquant son adversaire, mes
compagnons et moi, nous quitterions pour jamais cet homme que je n’osais
juger.
Je me disposais à descendre afin de les prévenir, lorsque le second monta
sur la plate−forme. Plusieurs marins l’accompagnaient. Le capitaine
Nemo ne les vit pas ou ne voulut pas les voir. Certaines dispositions furent
prises qu’on aurait pu appeler le « branle−bas de combat » du Nautilus.
Elles étaient très simples. La filière qui formait balustrade autour de la
plate−forme fut abaissée. De même, les cages du fanal et du timonier
rentrèrent dans la coque de manière à l’affleurer seulement. La surface du
long cigare de tôle n’offrait plus une seule saillie qui pût gêner sa
manoeuvre.
Je revins au salon. Le Nautilus émergeait toujours. Quelques lueurs
matinales s’infiltraient dans la couche liquide. Sous certaines ondulations
des lames, les vitres s’animaient des rougeurs du soleil levant. Ce terrible
jour du 2 juin se levait.
A cinq heures, le loch m’apprit que la vitesse du Nautilus se modérait. Je
compris qu’il se laissait approcher. D’ailleurs les détonations se faisaient
plus violemment entendre. Les boulets labouraient l’eau ambiante et s’y
vissaient avec un sifflement singulier.
« Mes amis, dis−je, le moment est venu. Une poignée de main, et que Dieu
nous garde ! »
Ned Land était résolu, Conseil calme, moi nerveux, me contenant à peine.
Nous passâmes dans la bibliothèque. Au moment où je poussais la porte
qui s’ouvrait sur la cage de l’escalier central, j’entendis le panneau
supérieur se fermer brusquement.
Le Canadien s’élança sur les marches, mais je l’arrêtai. Un sifflement bien
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 496
connu m’apprenait que l’eau pénétrait dans les réservoirs du bord. En
effet, en peu d’instants, le Nautilus s’immergea à quelques mètres
au−dessous de la surface des flots.
Je compris sa manoeuvre. Il était trop tard pour agir. Le Nautilus ne
songeait pas a frapper le deux−ponts dans son impénétrable cuirasse,
mais au−dessous de sa ligne de flottaison, là ou la carapace métallique ne
protège plus le bordé.
Nous étions emprisonnés de nouveau, témoins obligés du sinistre drame
qui se préparait. D’ailleurs, nous eûmes à peine le temps de réfléchir.
Réfugiés dans ma chambre, nous nous regardions sans prononcer une
parole. Une stupeur profonde s’était emparée de mon esprit. Le
mouvement de la pensée s’arrêtait en moi. . Je me trouvais dans cet état
pénible qui précède l’attente d’une détonation épouvantable. J’attendais,
j’écoutais, je ne vivais que par le sens de l’ouïe !
Cependant, la vitesse du Nautilus s’accrut sensiblement. C’était son élan
qu’il prenait ainsi. Toute sa coque frémissait.
Soudain, je poussai un cri. Un choc eut lieu, mais relativement léger. Je
sentis la force pénétrante de l’éperon d’acier. J’entendis des éraillements,
des raclements. Mais le Nautilus, emporté par sa puissance de propulsion,
passait au travers de la masse du vaisseau comme l’aiguille du voilier à
travers la toile !
Je ne pus y tenir. Fou, éperdu, je m’élançai hors de ma chambre et me
précipitai dans le salon.
Le capitaine Nemo était là. Muet, sombre, implacable, il regardait par le
panneau de bâbord.
Une masse énorme sombrait sous les eaux, et pour ne rien perdre de son
agonie, le Nautilus descendait dans l’abîme avec elle. A dix mètres de moi,
je vis cette coque entr’ouverte, où l’eau s’enfonçait avec un bruit de
tonnerre, puis la double ligne des canons et les bastingages. Le pont était
couvert d’ombres noires qui s’agitaient.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 497
L’eau montait. Les malheureux s’élançaient dans les haubans,
s’accrochaient aux mâts, se tordaient sous lés eaux. C’était une
fourmilière humaine surprise par l’envahissement d’une mer !
Paralysé, raidi par l’angoisse, les cheveux hérissés, l’oeil démesurément
ouvert, la respiration incomplète, sans souffle, sans voix, je regardais, moi
aussi ! Une irrésistible attraction me collait à la vitre !
L’énorme vaisseau s’enfonçait lentement. Le Nautilus le suivant, épiait
tous ses mouvements. Tout à coup, une explosion se produisit. L’air
comprimé fit voler les ponts du bâtiment comme si le feu eût pris aux
soutes. La poussée des eaux fut telle que le Nautilus dévia.
Alors le malheureux navire s’enfonça plus rapidement. Ses hunes,
chargées de victimes, apparurent, ensuite des barres, pliant sous des
grappes d’hommes. enfin le sommet de son grand mât. Puis, la masse
sombre disparut, et avec elle cet équipage de cadavres entraînés par un
formidable remous...
Je me retournai vers le capitaine Nemo. Ce terrible justicier, véritable
archange de la haine, regardait toujours. Quand tout fut fini, le capitaine
Nemo, se dirigeant vers la porte de sa chambre, l’ouvrit et entra. Je le
suivis des yeux.
Sur le panneau du fond, au−dessous des portraits de ses héros, je vis le
portrait d’une femme jeune encore et de deux petits enfants. Le capitaine
Nemo les regarda pendant quelques instants, leur tendit les bras, et,
s’agenouillant. il fondit en sanglots.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Une hécatombe 498
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo
Les panneaux s’étaient refermés sur cette vision effrayante, mais la
lumière n’avait pas été rendue au salon. A l’intérieur du Nautilus, ce
n’étaient que ténèbres et silence. Il quittait ce lieu de désolation, à cent
pieds sous les eaux, avec une rapidité prodigieuse. Où allait−il ? Au nord
ou au sud ? Où fuyait cet homme après cette horrible représaille ?
J’étais rentré dans ma chambre où Ned et Conseil se tenaient
silencieusement. J’éprouvais une insurmontable horreur pour le capitaine
Nemo. Quoi qu’il eût souffert de la part des hommes, il n’avait pas le droit
de punir ainsi. Il m’avait fait, sinon le complice, du moins le témoin de ses
vengeances ! C’était déjà trop.
A onze heures, la clarté électrique réapparut. Je passai dans le salon. Il
était désert. Je consultai les divers instruments. Le Nautilus fuyait dans le
nord avec une rapidité de vingt−cinq milles à l’heure, tantôt à la surface
de la mer, tantôt à trente pieds au−dessous.
Relèvement fait sur la carte, je vis que nous passions à l’ouvert de la
Manche, et que notre direction nous portait vers les mers boréales avec
une incomparable vitesse.
A peine pouvais−je saisir à leur rapide passage des squales au long nez,
des squales−marteaux, des roussettes qui fréquentent ces eaux, de grands
aigles de mer, des nuées d’hippocampes, semblables aux cavaliers du jeu
d’échecs, des anguilles s’agitant comme les serpenteaux d’un feu
d’artifice, des armées de crabes qui fuyaient obliquement en croisant leurs
pinces sur leur carapace, enfin des troupes de marsouins qui luttaient de
rapidité avec le Nautilus. Mais d’observer, d’étudier, de classer, il n’était
plus question alors. Le soir, nous avions franchi deux cents lieues de
l’Atlantique. L’ombre se fit, et la mer fut envahie par les ténèbres jusqu’au
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 499
lever de la lune. Je regagnai ma chambre. Je ne pus dormir. J’étais
assailli de cauchemars. L’horrible scène de destruction se répétait dans
mon esprit.
Depuis ce jour, qui pourra dire jusqu’où nous entraîna le Nautilus dans ce
bassin de l’Atlantique nord ? Toujours avec une vitesse inappréciable !
Toujours au milieu des brumes hyperboréennes ! Toucha−t−il aux pointes
du Spitzberg, aux accores de la Nouvelle−Zemble ? Parcourut−il ces mers
ignorées, la mer Blanche, la mer de Kara, le golfe de l’Obi, l’archipel de
Liarrov, et ces rivages inconnus de la côte asiatique ? Je ne saurais le
dire. Le temps qui s’écoulait je ne pouvais plus l’évaluer. L’heure avait été
suspendue aux horloges du bord. Il semblait que la nuit et le jour, comme
dans les contrées polaires, ne suivaient plus leur cours régulier. Je me
sentais entraîné dans ce domaine de l’étrange où se mouvait à l’aise
l’imagination surmenée d’Edgard Poë. A chaque instant, je m’attendais à
voir, comme le fabuleux Gordon Pym, « cette figure humaine voilée, de
proportion beaucoup plus vaste que celle d’aucun habitant de la terre,
jetée en travers de cette cataracte qui défend les abords du pôle » !
J’estime — mais je me trompe peut−être, j’estime que cette course
aventureuse du Nautilus se prolongea pendant quinze ou vingt jours, et je
ne sais ce qu’elle aurait duré, sans la catastrophe qui termina ce voyage.
Du capitaine Nemo, il n’était plus question. De son second, pas davantage.
Pas un homme de l’équipage ne fut visible un seul instant. Presque
incessamment, le Nautilus flottait sous les eaux. Quand ii remontait à leur
surface afin de renouveler son air, les panneaux s’ouvraient ou se
refermaient automatiquement. Plus de point reporté sur le planisphère. Je
ne savais où nous étions.
Je dirai aussi que le Canadien, à bout de forces et de patience, ne
paraissait plus. Conseil ne pouvait en tirer un seul mot, et craignait que,
dans un accès de délire et sous l’empire d’une nostalgie effrayante, il ne se
tuât. Il le surveillait donc avec un dévouement de tous les instants.
On comprend que, dans ces conditions, la situation n’était plus tenable.

Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 500
Un matin — à quelle date, je ne saurais le dire — je m’étais assoupi vers
les premières heures du jour, assoupissement pénible et maladif. Quand je
m’éveillai, je vis Ned Land se pencher sur moi, et je l’entendis me dire à
voix basse :
« Nous allons fuir ! »
Je me redressai.
« Quand fuyons−nous ? demandai−je.
— La nuit prochaine. Toute surveillance semble avoir disparu du Nautilus.
On dirait que la stupeur règne à bord. Vous serez prêt, monsieur ?
— Oui. Où sommes−nous ?
— En vue de terres que je viens de relever ce matin au milieu des brumes,
à vingt milles dans l’est.
— Quelles sont ces terres ?
— Je l’ignore, mais quelles qu’elles soient, nous nous y réfugierons.
— Oui ! Ned. Oui, nous fuirons cette nuit, dût la mer nous engloutir !
— La mer est mauvaise, le vent violent, mais vingt milles à faire dans cette
légère embarcation du Nautilus ne m’effraient pas. J’ai pu y transporter
quelques vivres et quelques bouteilles d’eau à l’insu de l’équipage.
— Je vous suivrai.
— D’ailleurs, ajouta le Canadien, si je suis surpris, je me défends, je me
fais tuer.
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 501
— Nous mourrons ensemble, ami Ned. »
J’étais décidé à tout. Le Canadien me quitta. Je gagnai la plate−forme,
sur laquelle je pouvais à peine me maintenir contre le choc des lames. Le
ciel était menaçant, mais puisque la terre était là dans ces brumes
épaisses, il fallait fuir. Nous ne devions perdre ni un jour ni une heure.
Je revins au salon, craignant et désirant tout à la fois de rencontrer le
capitaine Nemo, voulant et ne voulant plus le voir. Que lui aurais−je dit ?
Pouvais−je lui cacher l’involontaire horreur qu’il m’inspirait ! Non !
Mieux valait ne pas me trouver face à face avec lui ! Mieux valait
l’oublier ! Et pourtant !
Combien fut longue cette journée, la dernière que je dusse passer à bord
du Nautilus ! Je restais seul. Ned Land et Conseil évitaient de me parler
par crainte de se trahir.
A six heures, je dînai, mais je n’avais pas faim. Je me forçai à manger,
malgré mes répugnances, ne voulant pas m’affaiblir.
A six heures et demi, Ned Land entra dans ma chambre. Il me dit :
« Nous ne nous reverrons pas avant notre départ. A dix heures, la lune ne
sera pas encore levée. Nous profiterons de l’obscurité. Venez au canot.
Conseil et moi, nous vous y attendrons. »
Puis le Canadien sortit, sans m’avoir donné le temps de lui répondre.
Je voulus vérifier la direction du Nautilus. Je me rendis au salon. Nous
courions nord−nord−est avec une vitesse effrayante, par cinquante mètres
de profondeur.
Je jetai un dernier regard sur ces merveilles de la nature, sur ces richesses
de l’art entassées dans ce musée, sur cette collection sans rivale destinée à
périr un jour au fond des mers avec celui qui l’avait formée. Je voulus
fixer dans mon esprit une impression suprême. Je restai une heure ainsi,
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 502
baigné dans les effluves du plafond lumineux, et passant en revue ces
trésors resplendissant sous leurs vitrines. Puis, je revins à ma chambre.
Là, je revêtis de solides vêtements de mer. Je rassemblai mes notes et les
serrai précieusement sur moi. Mon coeur battait avec force. Je ne pouvais
en comprimer les pulsations. Certainement, mon trouble, mon agitation
m’eussent trahi aux yeux du capitaine Nemo.
Que faisait−il en ce moment ? J’écoutai à la porte de sa chambre.
J’entendis un bruit de pas. Le capitaine Nemo était là. Il ne s’était pas
couché. A chaque mouvement, il me semblait qu’il allait m’apparaître et
me demander pourquoi je voulais fuir ! J’éprouvais des alertes
incessantes. Mon imagination les grossissait. Cette impression devint si
poignante que je me demandai s’il ne valait pas mieux entrer dans la
chambre du capitaine, le voir face à face, le braver du geste et du regard !
C’était une inspiration de fou. Je me retins heureusement, et je m’étendis
sur mon lit pour apaiser en moi les agitations du corps. Mes nerfs se
calmèrent un peu, mais, le cerveau surexcité, je revis dans un rapide
souvenir toute mon existence à bord du Nautilus, tous les incidents
heureux ou malheureux qui l’avaient traversée depuis ma disparition de
l’Abraham−Lincoln, les chasses sous−marines, le détroit de Torrès, les
sauvages de la Papouasie, l’échouement, le cimetière de corail, le passage
de Suez, l’île de Santorin, le plongeur crétois, la baie de Vigo, l’Atlantide,
la banquise, le pôle sud, l’emprisonnement dans les glaces, le combat des
poulpes, la tempête du Gulf−Stream, le Vengeur, et cette horrible scène du
vaisseau coulé avec son équipage ! ... Tous ces événements passèrent
devant mes yeux, comme ces toiles de fond qui se déroulent à
l’arrière−plan d’un théâtre. Alors le capitaine Nemo grandissait
démesurément dans ce milieu étrange. Son type s’accentuait et prenait des
proportions surhumaines. Ce n’était plus mon semblable, c’était l’homme
des eaux, le génie des mers.
Il était alors neuf heures et demie. Je tenais ma tête à deux mains pour
l’empêcher d’éclater. Je fermais les yeux. Je ne voulais plus penser. Une
demi−heure d’attente encore ! Une demi−heure d’un cauchemar qui
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 503
pouvait me rendre fou !
En ce moment, j’entendis les vagues accords de l’orgue, une harmonie
triste sous un chant indéfinissable, véritables plaintes d’une âme qui veut
briser ses liens terrestres. J’écoutai par tous mes sens à la fois, respirant à
peine, plongé comme le capitaine Nemo dans ces extases musicales qui
l’entraînaient hors des limites de ce monde.
Puis, une pensée soudaine me terrifia. Le capitaine Nemo avait quitté sa
chambre. Il était dans ce salon que je devais traverser pour fuir. Là, je le
rencontrerais une dernière fois. Il me verrait, il me parlerait peut−être !
Un geste de lui pouvait m’anéantir, un seul mot, m’enchaîner à son bord !
Cependant, dix heures allaient sonner. Le moment était venu de quitter ma
chambre et de rejoindre mes compagnons.
Il n’y avait pas à hésiter, dût le capitaine Nemo se dresser devant moi.
J’ouvris ma porte avec précaution, et cependant, il me sembla qu’en
tournant sur ses gonds, elle faisait un bruit effrayant. Peut−être ce bruit
n’existait−il que dans mon imagination !
Je m’avançai en rampant à travers les coursives obscures du Nautilus,
m’arrêtant à chaque pas pour comprimer les battements de mon coeur.
J’arrivai à la porte angulaire du salon. Je l’ouvris doucement. Le salon
était plongé dans une obscurité profonde. Les accords de l’orgue
raisonnaient faiblement. Le capitaine Nemo était là. Il ne me voyait pas. Je
crois même qu’en pleine lumière, il ne m’eût pas aperçu, tant son extase
l’absorbait tout entier.
Je me traînai sur le tapis, évitant le moindre heurt dont le bruit eût pu
trahir ma présence. Il me fallut cinq minutes pour gagner la porte du fond
qui donnait sur la bibliothèque.
J’allais l’ouvrir, quand un soupir du capitaine Nemo me cloua sur place.
Je compris qu’il se levait. Je l’entrevis même, car quelques rayons de la
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 504
bibliothèque éclairée filtraient jusqu’au salon. Il vint vers moi, les bras
croisés, silencieux, glissant plutôt que marchant, comme un spectre. Sa
poitrine oppressée se gonflait de sanglots. Et je l’entendis murmurer ces
paroles — les dernières qui aient frappé mon oreille :
« Dieu tout puissant ! assez ! assez ! »
Était−ce l’aveu du remords qui s’échappait ainsi de la conscience de cet
homme ? ...
Éperdu, je me précipitai dans la bibliothèque. Je montai l’escalier central,
et, suivant la coursive supérieure, j’arrivai au canot. J’y pénétrai par
l’ouverture qui avait déjà livré passage à mes deux compagnons.
« Partons ! Partons ! m’écriai−je.
— A l’instant ! » répondit le Canadien.
L’orifice évidé dans la tôle du Nautilus fut préalablement fermé et
boulonné au moyen d’une clef anglaise dont Ned Land s’était muni.
L’ouverture du canot se ferma également, et le Canadien commença à
dévisser les écrous qui nous retenaient encore au bateau sous−marin.
Soudain un bruit intérieur se fit entendre. Des voix se répondaient avec
vivacité. Qu’y avait−il ? S’était−on aperçu de notre fuite ? Je sentis que
Ned Land me glissait un poignard dans la main.
« Oui ! murmurai−je, nous saurons mourir ! »
Le Canadien s’était arrêté dans son travail. Mais un mot, vingt fois répété,
un mot terrible, me révéla la cause de cette agitation qui se propageait à
bord du Nautilus. Ce n’était pas à nous que son équipage en voulait !
« Maelstrom ! Maelstrom ! » s’écriait−il.
Le Maelstrom ! Un nom plus effrayant dans une situation plus effrayante
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 505
pouvait−il retentir à notre oreille ? Nous trouvions−nous donc sur ces
dangereux parages de la côte norvégienne ? Le Nautilus était−il entraîné
dans ce gouffre, au moment où notre canot allait se détacher de ses
flancs ?
On sait qu’au moment du flux, les eaux resserrées entre les îles Feroë et
Loffoden sont précipitées avec une irrésistible violence. Elles forment un
tourbillon dont aucun navire n’a jamais pu sortir. De tous les points de
l’horizon accourent des lames monstrueuses. Elles forment ce gouffre
justement appelé le « Nombril de l’Océan », dont la puissance d’attraction
s’étend jusqu’à une distance de quinze kilomètres. Là sont aspirés non
seulement les navires, mais les baleines, mais aussi les ours blancs des
régions boréales.
C’est là que le Nautilus involontairement ou volontairement peut−être —
avait été engagé par son capitaine. Il décrivait une spirale dont le rayon
diminuait de plus en plus. Ainsi que lui, le canot, encore accroché à son
flanc, était emporté avec une vitesse vertigineuse. Je le sentais.
J’éprouvais ce tournoiement maladif qui succède à un mouvement de
giration trop prolongé. Nous étions dans l’épouvante, dans l’horreur
portée à son comble, la circulation suspendue, l’influence nerveuse
annihilée, traversés de sueurs froides comme les sueurs de l’agonie ! Et
quel bruit autour de notre frêle canot ! Quels mugissements que l’écho
répétait à une distance de plusieurs milles ! Quel fracas que celui de ces
eaux brisées sur les roches aiguës du fond, là où les corps les plus durs se
brisent, là où les troncs d’arbres s’usent et se font « une fourrure de poils
», selon l’expression norvégienne !
Quelle situation ! Nous étions ballottés affreusement. Le Nautilus se
défendait comme un être humain. Ses muscles d’acier craquaient. Parfois
il se dressait, et nous avec lui !
« Il faut tenir bon, dit Ned, et revisser les écrous ! En restant attachés au
Nautilus, nous pouvons nous sauver encore... ! »
Il n’avait pas achevé de parler, qu’un craquement se produisait. Les
écrous manquaient, et le canot, arraché de son alvéole, était lancé comme
20 000 lieues sous les mers
Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 506
la pierre d’une fronde au milieu du tourbillon.
Ma tête porta sur une membrure de fer, et, sous ce choc violent, je perdis
connaissance.

Les dernières paroles du capitaine Nemo 507
Conclusion
Voici la conclusion de ce voyage sous les mers. Ce qui se passa pendant
cette nuit, comment le canot échappa au formidable remous du Maelstrom,
comment Ned Land, Conseil et moi, nous sortîmes du gouffre, je ne saurai
le dire. Mais quand je revins à moi, j’étais couché dans la cabane d’un
pêcheur des îles Loffoden. Mes deux compagnons, sains et saufs étaient
près de moi et me pressaient les mains. Nous nous embrassâmes avec
effusion.
En ce moment, nous ne pouvons songer à regagner la France. Les moyens
de communications entre la Norvège septentrionale et le sud sont rares. Je
suis donc forcé d’attendre le passage du bateau à vapeur qui fait le service
bimensuel du Cap Nord.
C’est donc là, au milieu de ces braves gens qui nous ont recueillis, que je
revois le récit de ces aventures. Il est exact. Pas un fait n’a été omis, pas
un détail n’a été exagéré. C’est la narration fidèle de cette invraisemblable
expédition sous un élément inaccessible à l’homme, et dont le progrès
rendra les routes libres un jour.
Me croira−t−on ? Je ne sais. Peu importe, après tout. Ce que je puis
affirmer maintenant, c’est mon droit de parler de ces mers sous lesquelles,
en moins de dix mois j’ai franchi vingt mille lieues, de ce tour du monde
sous−marin qui m’a révélé tant de merveilles à travers le Pacifique,
l’Océan Indien, la mer Rouge, la Méditerranée, l’Atlantique, les mers
australes et boréales !
Mais qu’est devenu le Nautilus ? A−t−il résisté aux étreintes du
Maelstrom ? Le capitaine Nemo vit−il encore ? Poursuit−il sous l’Océan
ses effrayantes représailles, ou s’est−il arrêté devant cette dernière
hécatombe ? Les flots apporteront−ils un jour ce manuscrit qui renferme
toute l’histoire de sa vie ? Saurai−je enfin le nom de cet homme ? Le
Conclusion 508
vaisseau disparu nous dira−t−il, par sa nationalité, la nationalité du
capitaine Nemo ?
Je l’espère. J’espère également que son puissant appareil a vaincu la mer
dans son gouffre le plus terrible, et que le Nautilus a survécu là où tant de
navires ont péri ! S’il en est ainsi, si le capitaine Nemo habite toujours cet
Océan, sa patrie d’adoption, puisse la haine s’apaiser dans ce coeur
farouche ! Que la contemplation de tant de merveilles éteigne en lui
l’esprit de vengeance ! Que le justicier s’efface, que le savant continue la
paisible exploration des mers ! Si sa destinée est étrange, elle est sublime
aussi. Ne l’ai−je pas compris par moi−même ? N’ai−je pas vécu dix mois
de cette existence extranaturelle ? Aussi, à cette demande posée, il y a six
mille ans, par l’Éccclésiaste : « Qui a jamais pu sonder les profondeurs de
l’abîme ? » deux hommes entre tous les hommes ont le droit de répondre
maintenant. Le capitaine Nemo et moi.
